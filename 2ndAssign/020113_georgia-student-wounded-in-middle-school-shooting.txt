A student opened fire at an Atlanta middle school on Thursday afternoon, wounding a 14-year-old in the neck before an armed officer working there was able to wrest the gun away, the police said. Multiple shots were fired in the courtyard of Price Middle School, just south of downtown, about 1:50 p.m., Police Chief George Turner said. The boy who was wounded was taken “alert, conscious and breathing” to Grady Memorial Hospital, a police spokesman said. Hospital officials said the boy had been discharged by Thursday night. The police said charges were pending against the boy who opened fire. Investigators said that they believed it was not a random shooting and that the 14-year-old was the target.
