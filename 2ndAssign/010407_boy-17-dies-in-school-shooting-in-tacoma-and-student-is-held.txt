TACOMA, Wash., Jan. 3 — A student shot and killed another student at a public high school here on Wednesday, and the accused gunman was arrested a few hours later while walking down a nearby street, the police said.

The shooting happened just before 7:30 a.m. in a hallway outside classrooms at Foss High School, as students waited for a bell to signal the start of classes on the first day back after winter break. Several students reported hearing multiple gunshots and seeing blood on hallway lockers as the victim slumped to the floor. Many students and teachers took cover beneath tables.

The victim was identified by the Pierce County medical examiner as Samnang Kok, 17. The police did not identify the suspect but said he was 18 and had no prior record. They said he appeared to single out his victim and did not fire shots at anyone else. Pierce County jail records showed that Douglas S. Chanthabouly, 18, was booked for investigation of first-degree murder, and the local news media identified him as the suspect. Detectives were interviewing the suspect to try to determine a motive, and the police said the shooting did not appear to be gang related.

“The last word we got from the guys doing the investigation was they had no idea,” said Mark Fulghum, a spokesman for the Tacoma Police Department.

Chief Don Ramsdell said: “Not too far from here, they were able to locate the subject just walking down the street. He was taken into custody without incident. There was a weapon recovered, unknown if that was the actual weapon.”

Foss High School, which has about 1,700 students, does not have metal detectors but does employ private security guards, said Chris Taylor, a police detective.School was canceled after the shooting.
