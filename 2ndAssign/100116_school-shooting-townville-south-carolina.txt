A 6-year-old boy wounded in a school shooting in Townville, S.C., this week died on Saturday, officials said.

The boy, Jacob Hall, was struck in the leg on Wednesday when someone fired at Townville Elementary School in Anderson County. A 14-year-old boy, whom the authorities have not identified, has been charged in the shooting.

The bullet hit an artery and caused “catastrophic blood loss and resulting cardiopulmonary arrest,” Dr. Keith Webb of the Greenville Health System Children’s Hospital said in a statement.

Jacob’s parents, Renae and Rodger Hall, said in a statement that their son died surrounded by family. “Words cannot express how much we will miss him,” they said.

The suspect is also accused of killing his father, Jeffrey Osborne, 47. He had been charged on Friday with murder and three counts of attempted murder. Authorities have not determined a motive.
