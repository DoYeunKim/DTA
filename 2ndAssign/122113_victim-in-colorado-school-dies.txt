 Colorado high school student who was shot in the head on Dec. 13 by a schoolmate died on Saturday afternoon, her family and hospital officials said.

The victim, Claire Davis, 17, had been in critical condition since the shooting at Arapahoe High School in Centennial, a suburb of Denver.

“It is with unspeakable sadness that we write and say that Claire has passed away from the gunshot wound she received,” her family said in a statement. “We ask that you give us time to grieve the death of our daughter by respecting our wishes for privacy.”

Littleton Adventist Hospital, where Ms. Davis had been in a coma, said she died about 4:30 p.m. with her family by her side.

“Despite the best efforts of our physicians and nursing staff, and Claire’s fighting spirit, her injuries were too severe and the most advanced medical treatments could not prevent this tragic loss of life,” the hospital said in a statement on Facebook. “Claire’s death is immensely heartbreaking for our entire community, our staff and our families.”

Ms. Davis, a senior, was sitting near a school entrance when Karl H. Pierson, 18, fired a shotgun five times, hitting Ms. Davis in the head before killing himself. She was not a planned target, the authorities have said.
Mr. Pierson, a student at the school, possibly had planned to confront a librarian who had disciplined him, but he had enough weapons to hurt many others, the authorities have said. He was carrying three gasoline bombs, a machete and 125 rounds of ammunition, in addition to the shotgun, Sheriff Grayson Robinson of Arapahoe County has said.
