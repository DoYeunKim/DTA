At least three people were killed in a shooting at a high school in northern New Mexico on Thursday, including two students and the attacker, the police said.

The New Mexico State Police said no other injuries were reported after the shooting, which took place at Aztec High School in Aztec, N.M., before 10 a.m. The victims and the attacker have not been publicly identified.

The school was placed on lockdown, and the police said students were evacuated by bus to a nearby school soon after the shooting. The New Mexico State Police said shortly before 11 a.m. that they were conducting security checks at the school.

The school is in the Four Corners region of New Mexico, bordering Arizona, Colorado and Utah, and is close to the territory of the Navajo Nation.

Russell Begaye, the president of the Navajo Nation, said in a statement that all schools in the area had been placed on “preventative lockdown as a precautionary measure.”

“It’s tragic when our children are harmed in violent ways especially on school campuses,” Mr. Begaye said in a statement. “These things are unpredictable. We do all that we can to protect our loved ones, our children and family.”
The Office of the San Juan County Sheriff said the F.B.I. and the New Mexico State Police will investigate the shooting.
