The police say two suburban high school students had a pair of loaded handguns, a drawing depicting a killing and the intention of randomly shooting people on campus. The boys, ages 15 and 16, were arrested before any violence, after the older boy’s stepfather contacted West Covina police to say his guns were missing. The police said they found a .40-caliber handgun, a .357-caliber handgun and several rounds of rifle ammunition at the home of the older boy. Lt. Ron Mitchell of the West Covina Police Department said the boys had taken the weapons onto the campus of Covina High School three times, and they told investigators they were considering using them. Covina and West Covina are about 20 miles east of downtown Los Angeles. The boys’ identities were not released because they are juveniles. They were booked for investigation of burglary, possession of a loaded and concealed firearm, making criminal threats and possession of a loaded and concealed weapon on campus.
