 gunman armed with a semiautomatic AR-15 assault rifle and “countless magazines” killed at least 17 people at his former high school in Parkland, Fla., on Wednesday.
The heavily armed man, identified as Nikolas Cruz, 19, arrived at the school in an Uber at 2:19 p.m., shortly before dismissal time. He made his way “purposefully” toward the freshman building, said a police report released Thursday.
According to details described by authorities at a news conference on Thursday evening, Mr. Cruz shot people in the hallways and inside five classrooms on the first and second floors. He eventually discarded the rifle, a vest, and ammunition in a stairwell, and blended in with fleeing students to get away.
On the third floor, students were leaving their classroom when they heard gunshots, according to several students.
They ran back to their classroom, and their teacher, Scott Beigel, was shot and killed as he tried to lock the door, the students said.
As the gunman walked through the building, he shot into classrooms where students were crouched in corners and hiding in closets. After the shooting ended, students ran out of the building flanked by heavily armed police officers.
There are 30 classrooms in the building, which was originally built only for freshmen but is now used by students in other grades as well, said Melissa Falkowski, a teacher at the high school. All told, there are usually about 900 students and 30 teachers in the building on a typical school day.
Mr. Cruz, who had been expelled from the school, concealed himself in the crowd and was among the hundreds of people fleeing the building, authorities said. After leaving the school, he walked to a Walmart and bought a drink at a Subway, according to authorities. At 3:41 p.m., he was arrested by the police as he walked down a residential street in Coral Springs, just a few miles from the school. He was taken to a nearby hospital before being released into police custody.
