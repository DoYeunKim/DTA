The families of 21 people killed or injured in a shooting rampage last year at Red Lake High School reached a $1 million settlement with the school district that, if approved by the courts, would end civil litigation related to the matter. Jeff Weise, 16, fatally shot five students, a teacher and a security guard at the school before committing suicide in March 2005. The victims’ families, along with those who were wounded, would share $900,000 under the settlement, with $100,000 set aside for five years in case of additional claims. “The settlement is best for everyone because it provides these highly deserving families some measure of compensation for their losses and allows the school district to return all of its focus to education,” Philip Sieff, a lawyer who negotiated the deal, said.
