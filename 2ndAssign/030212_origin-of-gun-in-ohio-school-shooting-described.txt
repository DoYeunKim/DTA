When the 17-year-old T. J. Lane opened fire on students at Chardon High School, killing three and wounding two, the authorities say, he held a .22 caliber Mark III Target Rimfire pistol, a semiautomatic handgun made by Ruger that retails for $449 to $559.

The teenager, who was formally charged with three counts of aggravated murder on Thursday, is believed to have taken the gun from his grandfather’s barn. It was purchased, legally, in 2010 at an outdoor supplies store called Gander Mountain in Mentor, Ohio, the store confirmed. The gun has a capacity of 10 rounds; Mr. Lane was said to have fired 10 shots.

The Mark III is an updated version of the original pistol introduced by Ruger in 1949. It is favored for target shooting, said Kevin Reid, vice president and general counsel for Ruger. “People may take them out to shoot squirrels or rabbits or other types of small game,” he said. “But I think primarily these are guns that folks shoot at paper targets.”

Guns like these are often used for training. “Because it’s a very small cartridge, it doesn’t have a lot of recoil,” Mr. Reid said. Guns with bigger cartridges can be difficult for beginners to control.

In 2010, according to the F.B.I.’s Uniform Crime Report, handguns were responsible for 6,009 deaths. The federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives tracks which models are responsible for the most deaths. But the agency stopped making those records public in 2003 when Congress barred the agency from releasing information from its firearms trace database to anyone other than a law enforcement official or prosecutor.
