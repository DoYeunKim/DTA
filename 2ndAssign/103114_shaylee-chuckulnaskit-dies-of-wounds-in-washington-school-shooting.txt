A 14-year-old girl who was shot in the head last week when a classmate opened fired in a high school cafeteria in Washington State has died, hospital officials said Friday.

The girl, Shaylee Chuckulnaskit, died at Providence Regional Medical Center in Everett, the hospital said in a statement.

In the statement, her family said it was heartbroken by her death.

“We can’t imagine life without her,” the family said.

Shaylee was critically wounded in the Oct. 24 shooting at the Marysville-Pilchuck High School in Marysville, about 35 miles north of Seattle.

The assailant, Jaylen Ray Fryberg, 14, struck five schoolmates before committing suicide with a single gunshot to the head. One of them, Zoe Galasso, 14, died at the scene. Gia Soriano, 14, who was also shot in the head, died on Sunday.

Two boys — Nate Hatch, 14, and Andrew Fryberg, 15, cousins of Jaylen Fryberg — were being treated at Harborview Medical Center in Seattle; one had been shot in the jaw, and the other in the head. The girls had undergone surgery at Providence.

Jaylen Fryberg was a freshman football player who had been elected homecoming prince.
