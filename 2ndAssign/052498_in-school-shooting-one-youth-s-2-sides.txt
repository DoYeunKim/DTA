Kip Kinkel's parents had worried about his temper since he was a little boy. They sent him to a psychiatrist and taught him at home for a time. In recent months, they thought that their work and concern were making a difference and that Kip, at 15, was turning around.

But the teen-ager, who is accused of killing his parents and two of his schoolmates in Springfield, Ore., never made a secret of his angry heart.

The picture of him that has emerged since the shootings on Thursday at his school and his home is split: The boy with a great sense of humor, as well as that terrible temper. The teen-ager who built tree houses for his friends, and tortured squirrels and chipmunks. The polite youngster who behaved impeccably around adults and was a tough-talking mischief-maker at school.
