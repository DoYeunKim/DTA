The police today arrested a teen-age suspect in the shooting of four students outside a high school here Thursday. The suspect, Rodney Reardon, 18 years old, of Washington, was charged with assult with attempt to murder. It was initially believed that the shooting, in which the victims were only slightly wounded, had been the work of one young gunman, accompanied by another youth. But an affidavit presented at Mr. Reardon's arraignment in District of Columbia Superior Court today said he was one of two gunmen who had been among a group of "at least four males." The police are still searching for the others.
