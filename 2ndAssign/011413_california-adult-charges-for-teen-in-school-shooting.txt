 16-year-old boy who was teased by his California high school classmates for his red hair, social awkwardness and bookish appearance will be charged as an adult for allegedly wounding a classmate with a shotgun and trying to target another. The boy, Bryan Oliver, will face two counts of premeditated attempted murder and three counts of assault with a firearm in the attack Thursday at Taft Union High School, the Kern County district attorneyâ€™s office said.
