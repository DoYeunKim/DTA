ARE BASED ON THE SITES WE VISITED lx WE RE ONLY SEEING PART THE CRACK BABY PROBLEM ONLY EIGHT OP THE CITIES WE VISITED COULD TELL US THE NUMBER Or BABIES REPORTED TO CHILD WELFARE THESE EIGHT CITIES HANDLED CRACK BABIES DURING THE PREVIOUS YEAR THESE CITIES ACCOUNT FOR PERCENT THE POPULATION OF U S CITIES MORE THAN SINCE WE BELIEVE THAT AS FEW HALF THE CRACK BABIES ARE ACTUALLY REPORTED TO CHILD WELFARE IT IS REASONABLE TO ESTIMATE AS CONTAINED IN THE PRESIDENT S NATIONAL DRUG CONTROL STRATEGY REPORT THAT AS MANY COCAINE BABIES ARE BORN EVERY YEAR WE COST OF HOSPITAL DELIVERY AND PERINATAL CARE AND FOSTER CARE FOR THE IDENTIFIED BABIES WILL APPROXIMATE MILLION FOR THEIR FIRST FIVE YEARS OF LIFE SOME CRACK BABIES WILL ALSO NEED OTHER SERVICES THE FLORIDA DEPARTMENT OF HUMAN RESOURCES HAS ESTIMATED A YEARLY COST OF OVER PER CHILD TO GET CRACK BABIES READY FOR SCHOOL IF THE OTHER IN OUR STUDY WERE TO PROVIDE SIMILAR SERVICES FOR THE IDENTIFIED BABIES THE ADDITIONAL COSTS THESE DEVELOPMENTAL INTERVENTION EDUCATION AND HEALTH SERVICES COULD EXCEED BILLION THE FIRST FIVE YEARS THESE BABIES LIVES < THESE ESTIMATES DON T INCLUDE COSTS FOR ANY OTHER SERVICES WHICH MIGHT BE NEEDED AFTER AGE BUT SUCH COSTS COULD BE SUBSTANTIAL IN THE STATE OF PENNSYLVANIA FOR EXAMPLE YEAR SPECIAL EDUCATION IN A CLASS FOR A LEARNING DISABLED CHILD COSTS YEAR RESIDENTIAL TREATMENT AND SPECIAL EDUCATION FOR AN EMOTIONALLY DISTURBED CHILD COSTS BETWEEN AND AVERAGE EPISODE OF JUVENILE DETENTION LASTS IS DAYS AND COSTS ABOUT ROUND OF RESIDENTIAL DRUG TREATMENT A TEENAGER COULD COST OR MORE WE THERE NO " TYPICAL " CRACK BABY PERCENT LOOK HEALTHY AND MOST ARE NOT IDENTIFIED AT BIRTH MANY RESPONDENTS ARE CONCERNED THE EFFECTS OF COCAINE EXPOSURE MAY NOT APPEAR THE AGE OF OR THEY THIS WHEN THE CHILDREN BEGIN TO DISPLAY DEVELOPMENTAL NEUROLOGICAL AND EMOTIONAL PROBLEMS HOSPITALS DON T TEST NEWBORN BABIES OR THEIR FOR DRUGS THIS ESPECIALLY TRUE IN PRIVATE AND SUBURBAN HOSPITALS WHERE INFORMATION ON CRACK BABIES IS ALMOST NON EXISTANT INSTEAD THEY RELY ON THE MOTHERS TO SELF REPORT THEIR DRUG USE HOWEVER MANY MOTHERS DON T ADMIT USING DRUGS A SURVEY IN ONE FLORIDA HOSPITAL ONLY PERCENT THE PREGNANT WOKEN WHO TESTED POSITIVE FOR DRUG USE DURING DELIVERY HAD ADMITTED THEIR USE WHEN TESTS ARE DONE THEY PROVIDE ONLY LIMITED INFORMATION THIS TESTS CAN ONLY DETECT COCAINE IN THE MOTHER FOR TO HOURS AFTER USE ACCORDING TO EXPERTS CRACK BABIES ARE TIMES MORE LIKELY TO BE BORN PREMATURE THAN BABIES NOT EXPOSED TO DRUGS IN UTERO SOME WILL REQUIRE SPECIAL MEDICAL ATTENTION AT BIRTH AND AFTER HOSPITAL DISCHARGE WHAT S AHEAD FOR CRACK BABIES OUR RESPONDENTS WORRY THAT MANY HAVE SEVERE LEARNING DISABILITIES AND WILL NEED SPECIAL EDUCATION WE THE LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT HAS ALREADY DEVELOPED A SPECIAL CURRICULUM FOR CRACK BABIES IN PRESCHOOL THE CHILD WELFARE SYSTEM IS STRUGGLING TO COPE ACCORDING TO OUR RESPONDENTS THE NUMBER OF DRUG ABUSE CASES IS GOING UP IN NEW YORK CITY CHILD ABUSE CASES DUE TO DRUG DEPENDENCY WENT UP PERCENT FROM TO CRACK BABY CASES ARE COMPLICATED AND TIME CONSUMING STATE OFFICIALS US THAT CRACK USERS REPRESENT A DIFFERENT KIND OF PROTECTIVE SERVICES CASE THAN THEY ARE USED TO — THERE LOT MORE ABANDONMENT AND VIOLENCE CRACK NOT TEENAGERS THEIR AVERAGE AGE TO YEARS AND MANY ARE IN THEIR EARLY USUALLY THEY TO OTHER CHILDREN CRACK BABIES REPORTED TO THE CHILD WELFARE SYSTEM ARE PRIMARILY BLACK WITH A SMALLER NUMBER OF HISPANICS AND EVEN FEWER WHITES CAN SPEND DAYS TRACKING DOWN MOTHERS WHO GIVE FALSE ADDRESSES TO HOSPITALS AND THEN ABANDON THEIR BABIES THEY ALSO SPEND TIME FINDING EMERGENCY PLACEMENTS FOSTER CARE DRUG TREATMENT THE MOTHERS AND OTHER SPECIAL SERVICES PRENATAL EXPOSURE TO DRUGS IS OFTEN NOT TREATED AS CHILD ABUSE BABIES WHO TEST POSITIVE FOR DRUGS ARE NOT ALWAYS REPORTED TO CHILD WELFARE OFFICIALS THE ACTIONS DEPEND ON HOW A STATE DEFINES CHILD ABUSE OR NEGLECT THESE DEFINITIONS VARY FROM STATE TO STATE THE WE VISITED REQUIRE HOSPITALS TO REPORT A POSITIVE DRUG TEST TO CHILD WELFARE OR A CENTRAL STATE REGISTRY SOME HOSPITALS IN OTHER SITES MAKE VOLUNTARY REFERRALS AT ONE SITE HOSPITALS WERE INSTRUCTED TO REPORT CASES ONLY WHEN THE MOTHER CANNOT CARE FOR HER CHILD AT ANOTHER SITE DRUG EXPOSURE CASES ARE INVESTIGATED ONLY IP OTHER FACTORS ARE PRESENT SUCH PRIOR ABUSE REPORTS GOOD NEWS SEVERAL CHILD WELFARE AGENCIES ARE USING NEW APPROACHES TO DEAL WITH CRACK BABY CASES SEVERAL CITIES HAVE SET UP HIGH RISK DRUG BABY UNITS IN THESE UNITS ARE SPECIALLY TRAINED TO HANDLE THE NEEDS OF CRACK BABIES AND THEIR MOTHERS IN ONE CITY VISITED THE IN THESE UNITS HAVE REDUCED CASELOADS CHILD WELFARE AGENCY HAS DECENTRALIZED SERVICES TO THE COMMUNITY LEVEL WORKING RIGHT NEIGHBORHOOD THEY SERVE ENABLES CASEWORKERS TO BECOME MORE FAMILIAR WITH LOCAL SERVICES AND PROVIDE BETTER SUPPORT FOR FAMILIES CHILD WELFARE AGENCIES IN OTHER CITIES ARE ALSO CONSIDERING THIS APPROACH SOME CITIES ARE GIVING THEIR CASEWORKERS MORE TRAINING LAST YEAR NEW YORK CITY ALONE TRAINED OVER NEW CASEWORKERS MANY RESPONDENTS TOLD US THAT CHILD WELFARE CASEWORKERS NEED SPECIAL TRAINING TO IDENTIFY SUBSTANCE ABUSERS AND THEIR CHILDREN AND TO ASSESS THEIR SERVICE NEEDS THESE ARE JUST A FEW THE NEW APPROACHES WE FOUND WE NOW PREPARING A REPORT ON THESE AND OTHER PRACTICES FOUND TO BE EFFECTIVE IN DEALING WITH CRACK BABIES AND THEIR MOTHERS WE PLAN TO ISSUE THIS COMPANION REPORT IN THE NEAR FUTURE IN SOME CITIES HOSPITALS ARE PERFORMING TRADITIONAL CHILD WELFARE FUNCTIONS THESE HOSPITALS RECRUIT FOSTER PARENTS AND MAKE PLACEMENT RECOMMENDATIONS TO CHILD WELFARE THEY ALSO FIND PROVIDE AND COORDINATE A WIDE RANGE OF SERVICES FOR CRACK MOTHERS AND BABIES LACK COORDINATION IS THE MOST DIFFICULT PROBLEM THEY FACE IN PROVIDING SERVICES ACCORDING TO MANY RESPONDENTS SOME ARE TACKLING THIS ISSUE IN ILLINOIS FOR EXAMPLE CHILD WELFARE ALCOHOLISM AND SUBSTANCE ABUSE AND RELATED PROGRAMS NOW COLLABORATE TO PROVIDE COMPREHENSIVE SERVICES TO CRACK MOTHERS AND BABIES IN MIAMI AND FORT WAYNE FAMILY COURTS AND CHILD WELFARE AGENCIES WORK TOGETHER TO MOVE CASES THROUGH THE SYSTEM FASTER THEY CALL THIS PROCESS " FAST TRACKING IT ENABLES THEM TO EXPEDITE THEIR PLACEMENT DECISIONS MANY SITES HAVE TASK FORCES TO ADDRESS THE CRACK BABY PROBLEM STATE ATTORNEYS GENERAL GOVERNORS AND MAYORS HAVE CREATED TASKS FORCES STAFFED BY PRIVATE CITIZENS GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS AND MEDICAL AND CHILD DEVELOPMENT EXPERTS THEY IDENTIFY AND PULL TOGETHER SERVICE PROVIDERS RECOMMEND POLICIES AND INTEGRATE MONIES FOR SERVICES TO HIGH RISK FAMILES COMPREHENSIVE CASE MANAGEMENT IS ESSENTIAL TO HELP CRACK MOTHERS AND BABIES ACCORDING TO OUR RESPONDENTS CASE MANAGEMENT CONSISTS OP GUIDING FAMILIES TO A HIDE RANGE OF SERVICES SUCH AS HEALTH CARE EDUCATION COUNSELING DRUG REHABILITATION AND PARENTING CLASSES RESPONDENTS SAY THAT CRACK ADDICTS * PROBLEMS ARE SO COMPLEX AND THEIR ADDICTION SO OVERWHELMING THAT PROFESSIONAL CASE MANAGEMENT IS ESSENTIAL IT S JUST NOT REASONABLE TO EXPECT THEM TO SEEK OUT SERVICES THEMSELVES li BABIES GO HOME WITH THEIR MOTHER OR GRANDMOTHER MANY GO INTO FOSTER CARE APPROXIMATELY PERCENT OF IDENTIFIED CJIACK BABIES GO HOME WITH THEIR MOTHER OR ANOTHER RELATIVE USUAJXY THEIR MATERNAL GRANDMOTHER IN SOME CITIES SUCH N Y ., RELATIVES CAN RECEIVE FOSTER CARE STATUS OPINIONS ON THIS APPROACH VARY SOME BELIEVE HAVING RELATIVES AS FOSTER PARENTS GOOD IDEA OTHERS IT CAN DELAY REUNIFICATION OF MOTHER AND BABY PIT ONE FAMILY MEMBER AGAINST ANOTHER AND PERPETUATE THE BABY S FOSTER CARE STATUS OFFICIALS IN OUR STUDY ESTIMATE THAT PERCENT OF IDENTIFIED CRACK BABIES GO INTO FOSTER CARE BUT ACCORDING TO SOME OFFICIALS MANY CHILDREN ARE LEFT WITH THEIR NATURAL PARENTS BECAUSE NO FOSTER PLACEMENTS ARE AVAILABLE OFFICIALS IN CHICAGO NEWARK AND WASHINGTON D C REPORT CRITICAL FOSTER CARE SHORTAGE OTHER CITIES IN OUR STUDY ARE COPING THE TOTAL NUMBER OF CHILDREN WHO NEED FOSTER PLACEMENT IS INCREASING IN NEEDED PLACEMENT BY NUMBER ROSE TO TO DEAL WITH THE DEMAND SOME AGENCIES PUT MORE CHILDREN IN EACH FOSTER HOME SHIFT CHILDREN BETWEEN HOMES SEPARATE SIBLINGS AND PLACE CHILDREN IN GROUP HOMES BLACK FOSTER PARENTS AND HOMES THAT ACCEPT INFANTS ARE IN SHORT SUPPLY RESPONDENTS IN YOUR CITIES REPORT A PARTICULAR SHORTAGE OF HOMES FOR INFANTS WITH SPECIAL NEEDS IN STATE THAT LIMITS INTERRACIAL PLACEMENT THE BABIES ARE PREDOMINANTLY BLACK BUT WE WERE TOLD THERE SHORTAGE OF BLACK FOSTER PARENTS LOW REIMBURSEMENT IS ONE REASON THE FOSTER PARENT SHORTAGE RESPONDENTS SAY REIMBURSEMENTS ARE TOO LOW TO ATTRACT FULL TIME FOSTER PARENTS ESPECIALLY FOR BABIES WITH SPECIAL MEDICAL NEEDS REIMBURSEMENT RATE SCHEDULES ARE COMPLEX AND LACK UNIFORMITY CITY VISITED HAS DIFFERENT PAYMENT CATEGORIES RANGING FROM TO YEAR RESPONDENTS ALSO SUGGEST FOSTER PARENTS NEED TRAINING AND SUPPORT SERVICES SUCH AS DAY CARE TRANSPORTATION RESPITE AND BETTER ACCESS TO HEALTH AND MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES FOR THEIR FOSTER CHILDREN • NEWS ACCOUNTS FROM MANY CITIES REPORT GOOD RESULTS FROM OUTREACH EFFORTS SUCH NEWSPAPER STORIES RADIO AND TV TALK SHOWS AND PAID ADVERTISING BUT THESE EFFORTS OFTEN RESULT IN AN OUTPOURING OF COMMUNITY RESPONSE THE NUMBER WHO ACTUALLY GO ON TO BECOME FOSTER PARENTS IS LOWER BECAUSE SOME APPLICANTS ARE DISQUALIFIED AND OTHERS LOSE INTEREST RESTRICTIONS ON INTERRACIAL PLACEMENTS AND REQUIRING FOSTER PARENTS TO LIVE WITHIN CERTAIN GEOGRAPHIC LIMITS HAVE ALSO REDUCED THE POOL OF FOSTER PARENTS OTHER HAND EVEN WITH SCREENING SOME RESPONDENTS FEEL THE QUALIFICATIONS OF FOSTER PARENTS HAVE DECLINED IN SOME PLACES APPLICANTS WITH " MARGINAL * QUALIFICATIONS WHO WOULD HAVE BEEN TURNED AWAY A FEW YEARS AGO ARE NOW BEING ACCEPTED SOME GO TO OTHER SETTINGS ALTHOUGH THE VAST MAJORITY OF CRACK BABIES GO HOME WITH MOTHER OR ARE PLACED IN FOSTER CARE SOME MUST GO INTO EMERGENCY OR CONGREGATE CARE EMERGENCY CARE TEMPORARY PLACEMENT \ USUALLY DAYS IN A SMALL GROUP HOME A LARGE SHELTER OR WITH A FOSTER FAMILY IT INTENDED TO FILL THE GAP JUST UNTIL THE BABY GOES HOME WITH A PARENT OR IS PLACED IN FOSTER CARE BUT IP A LONG PLACEMENT CAN T BE MADE THE TIME LIMIT A CASEWORKER MAY BE FORCED TO MOVE THE BABY FROM ONE EMERGENCY PLACEMENT TO ANOTHER CONGREGATE CARE A PERMANENT GROUP HOME AND IT S USUALLY FOR OLDER CHILDREN BUT A FEW CRACK BABIES HAVE BEEN PLACED IN THIS TYPE SETTING WE ENCOUNTERED STRONG OPINIONS ABOUT CONGREGATE CARE SOME RESPONDENTS IT CAN WORK A SUBSTITUTE FOR FOSTER CARE AS LONG THE HOMES ARE SMALL KEEP SIBLINGS TOGETHER AND HAVE PROFESSIONAL STAFF OTHERS HOWEVER THINK IT S A BAD IDEA A FEW BABIES GO WITH THEIR TO RESIDENTIAL DRUG TREATMENT THEY AT THESE CENTERS FROM MONTHS TO YEARS DEPENDING ON THEIR TREATMENT NEEDS SEVEN CITIES VISITED HAVE AT LEAST OF THESE CENTERS AND RESPONDENTS SAY MANY MORE ARE NEEDED SOME BABIES STAY IX THE HOSPITAL EVEN THOUGH THEY ARE MEDICALLY READY FOR DISCHARGE KNOWN " BOARDER BABIES ," THESE INFANTS FACE LEGAL COMPLICATIONS QUESTIONS ABOUT PARENTS ABILITY TO TAKE CARE OF THEM OR LACK OF PLACEMENT ALTERNATIVES BUT ABOUT HALF THE SITES VISITED NEVER BOARDER BABY PROBLEM QUARTER HAVE MADE TIMELY PLACEMENTS AND THE REMAINDER REPORT A SEVERE PROBLEM WE ARE PREPARING A COMPANION REPORT ON BOARDER BABIES WHICH BE SHORTLY FEW HAVE BEEN ADOPTED A FEW CRACK BABIES HAVE BEEN ADOPTED ADOPTION PROCESS IS LONG DIFFICULT AND EXPENSIVE PROSPECTIVE PARENTS CAN BECOME FRUSTRATED AND GIVE UP MOST PROSPECTIVE PARENTS WANT BABIES BUT OFFICIALS TELL US THAT TERMINATION OF PARENTAL RIGHTS IS USUALLY CONTESTED AND THE PROCESS TAKES BY THEN MANY CHILDREN ARE TOO OLD TO BE ADOPTED RESPONDENTS CITED OTHER HINDRANCES TO ADOPTION EXAMPLE MENTIONED A LAW WHICH REQUIRES A HOUR WAITING PERIOD THE MOTHER DECIDES TO VOLUNTARILY RELINQUISH PARENTAL RIGHTS THIS BE PROBLEM BECAUSE A CRACK MOTHER LEAVES THE HOSPITAL SHE SOMETIMES CAN T BE FOUND AGAIN ANOTHER BARRIER TO ADOPTION THE BIAS AGAINST INTERRACIAL PLACEMENT SOME RESPONDENTS SAY WHITF FAMILIES DON T WANT BLACK BABIES STATE AND LOCAL CHILD WELFARE AGENCIES ARE SLOW TO APPROVE INTERRACIAL ADOPTIONS MANY RESPONDENTS SAY THE EXISTING POLICY GOAL OF FAMILY REUNIFICATION IS UNREALISTIC FOR SOME CRACX BABIES AND SIMPLY ADOPTION PROCESS BUT OTHERS FEEL STRONGLY THE CURRENT GOAL OF FAMILY REUNIFICATION SHOULD REMAIN RESPONDENTS IF PARENTAL RIGHTS WERE TERMINATED MOST CRACK BABIES WOULD NOT BE ADOPTED SOME CASEWORKERS FRANKLY SAY THERE ARE NOT ENOUGH PEOPLE WILLING TO ADOPT " THESE KIND OF CHILDREN ." PROSPECTIVE PARENTS FEAR LONG TERM EFFECTS OF CRACK AND POTENTIALLY EXPENSIVE MEDICAL EDUCATIONAL OR PSYCHOLOGICAL NEEDS SOME CITIES NOW PROVIDE ADOPTION SUBSIDIES FOR HARD TO PLACE CHILDREN ALLOWED UNDER FEDERAL LAW Sul ARE WORRIED ABOUT PRENATAL EXPOSURE TO ALL DRUGS NOT JUST CRACK RESPONDENTS REPEATEDLY US IT MAKES NO SENSE TO SEPARATE CRACK FROM OTHER DRUGS ESPECIALLY IN DEALING WITH THE EFFECTS OF PRENATAL EXPOSURE THEY MANY CRACK MOTHERS ESPECIALLY ON THE EAST COAST ALSO HAVE AIDS THEY ALSO MENTION OTHER NEW DRUGS SUCH " ICE METHAMPHETIMINE DERIVATIVE KNOWN TO PRODUCE RAPID EXTENSIVE FETAL DAMAGE IN FACT THEY THAT CRACK ADDICTS USE SO MANY OTHER DRUGS AND ALCOHOL IT S FUTILE TO TARGET JUST CRACK ALTHOUGH THERE CLEAR CONSENSUS ON EXACTLY WHAT TO DO RESPONDENTS EXPRESSED A SENSE OF URGENCY TO DO SOMETHING THEY REPEATEDLY CALLED FOR STRONG FEDERAL LEADERSHIP ACCURATE INFORMATION AND HEIGHTENED PUBLIC AWARENESS MANY SUGGESTED A NATIONAL COMMISSION ON PRENATAL DRUG EXPOSURE COULD RAISE AWARENESS AND EDUCATE THE PUBLIC ABOUT PREVENTION RECOMMENDATIONS WE AGREE WITH RESPONDENTS THE PROBLEMS OF CRACK BABIES ARE INSEPARABLE THE LARGER ISSUE OF PRENATAL EXPOSURE TO ALL DRUGS AND ALCOHOL OUR RECOMMENDATIONS FOR STATE AND LOCAL AS WELL THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT ARE INTENDED TO ADDRESS THIS BROADER ISSUE STATE AND LOCAL RESPONSIBILITIES *. STATE AND LOCAL GOVERNMENTS SHOULD CONDUCT AGGRESSIVE OUTREACH PROGRAMS TO IDENTIFY AT RISK PREGNANT WOMEN AND GET THEM INTO PRENATAL CARE THESE PROGRAMS SHOULD USE LOCAL COMMUNITY AND RELIGIOUS LEADERS TO IDENTIFY POTENTIAL CLIENTS AND ENCOURAGE THEM TO PARTICIPATE STATE LOCAL GOVERNMENTS SHOULD REDUCE BARRIERS TO FOSTER CARE AND ADOPTIVE PLACEMENTS THIS WOULD INVOLVE REVIEWING AND REVISING EXISTING LAWS AND POLICIES ON ABANDONMENT TERMINATION OF PARENTAL RIGHTS AND INTERRACIAL PLACEMENT COURTS SHOULD ESTABLISH PROCEDURES TO EXPEDITE CHILD WELFARE CASES INVOLVING DRUG ABUSE IL *. STATE AND LOCAL GOVERNMENTS SHOULD DEVELOP GUIDELINES AND TRAIN CASEWORKERS THE GUIDELINES SHOULD COVER RISK ASSESSMENT FAMILY REUNIFICATION AND TERMINATION OF PARENTAL RIGHTS BE TRAINED TO IDENTIFY SUBSTANCE ABUSE BEHAVIORS RECORD DRUG HISTORIES AND DOCUMENT EVIDENCE FOR COURT FEDERAL RESPONSIBILITIES Ij THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES SHOULD CONDUCT LONG TERM RESEARCH ON THE EFFECTS OF PRENATAL EXPOSURE TO DRUGS ON BABIES AND THEIR MOTHER AREAS WHERE RESEARCH SHOULD BE CONDUCTED INCLUDE THE LONG TERM EFFECTS OF PRENATAL DRUG EXPOSURE ON PHYSICAL PSYCHOLOGICAL AND NEUROLOGICAL DEVELOPMENT LONG TERM OUTCOMES OF VARIOUS TREATMENT APPROACHES FOR WOKEN OF CHILD BEARING AGE RESULTS OF PERMANENT PLACEMENT OPTIONS DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES SHOULD PROMOTE DRUG ABUSE TRAINING IN MEDICAL SCHOOLS AND CHILD WELFARE AGENCIES NOT TRAINED TO RECOGNIZE THE SIGNS OF DRUG USE RESULT THEY FAIL TO IDENTIFY MANY PREGNANT WOMEN WHO ARE USING DRUGS AS WELL Vt NEWBORNS EXPOSED IN UTERO MEDICAL SCHOOL CURRICULA SHOULD BE REVISED TO INCLUDE TRAINING ON HQW TO RECOGNIZE AND TREAT DRUG ABUSE HHS SHOULD ASSIST STATE AND LOCAL CHILD WELFARE AGENCIES BY DEVELOPING AND DISSEMINATING MODEL TRAINING MATERIALS FOR CHILD WELFARE AGENCIES * ix DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AMP HUMAN SERVICES SHOULD CONTINUE TO SUPPORT PRENATAL CARE EXPANSION AND PROMOTE PREVENTION THROUGH PUBLIC OUTREACH AND INFORMATIONAL MATERIALS EXISTING ANTI DRUG MESSAGES DO NOT EMPHASIZE THE DANGERS OF PRENATAL DRUG EXPOSURE A COMPREHENSIVE STRATEGY SHOULD BE DEVELOPED TO TARGET WOMEN CHILDBEARING AGE
