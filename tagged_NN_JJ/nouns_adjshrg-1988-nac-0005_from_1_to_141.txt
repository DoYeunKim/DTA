THE TESTING AND APPROVAL OF DRUGS BEFORE USE BY THE GENERAL PUBLIC HOWEVER EFFORTS TO MINIMIZE THE CURRENT CERTIFICATION PROCESS BY EDA WOULD ENCOURAGE MORE HARMFUL ILLEGAL DRUGS ON THE MARKET THE NATIONAL MEDICAL ASSOCIATION SUPPORTS MORE FEDERAL EFFORTS TO EXPAND DRUG ABUSE PROGRAMS BY URGING MORE FOR PREVENTION COUNSELING AND TREATMENT PROGRAMS MIA SUPPORTS AN INCREASE IN FEDERAL FUNDING TO EXPAND THE NATION S DRUG WAR TO BILLION OR THE REAGAN ADMINISTRATION HAS BUDGETED FOR FISCAL YEAR Ml CHAIRMAN THE U S DRUG PROBLEM IS GETTING WORSE NOT BETTER WE ARE LOOSING THE WAR YOU WELL KNOW TO
