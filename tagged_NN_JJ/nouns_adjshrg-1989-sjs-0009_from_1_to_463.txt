ADMINISTRATIVE PRACTICE THE SENATE COMMITTEE ON THE JUDICIARY APRIL IN MOBILE ALABAMA GOOD MORNING MR CHAIRMAN CAPTAIN LARRY R HYDE COMMANDER OF U S COAST GUARD GROUP MOBILE ALABAMA PLEASED TO APPEAR THIS DISTINGUISHED COMMITTEE TODAY TO DISCUSS THE ROLE THE UNITED COAST GUARD IN STEMMING THE FLOW OF ILLEGAL DRUGS INTO THE GULF COAST OF THB UNITED COAST GUARD GROUP MOBILE IS RESPONSIBLE FOR SEARCH AND RESCUE AIDS TO NAVIGATION AND LAW ENFORCEMENT INCLUDING DRUG INTERDICTION THE COASTAL AREAS A THREE STATE REGION FROM ST HARKS RIVER FLORIDA WEST TO BILOXI MISSISSIPPI ARE APPROXIMATELY PERSONNEL ASSIGNED TO UNITS IN GROUP MOBILE TO PERFORM THESE MISSIONS TO ASSURE YOU THAT GROUP MOBILE IS COMMITTED TO ENFORCING ALL FEDERAL LAWS AND REGULATIONS ON WATERS SUBJECT TO OUR JURISDICTION AND AREA OF RESPONSIBILITY PRIMARILY WE FOCUS MOST OF CUR LAW ENFORCEMENT EFFORTS ON ILLEGAL DRUG INTERDICTION IN AN AREA EXTENDING FROM THE SHORELINE SEAWARD APPROXIMATELY NAUTICAL MILES FIVE COASTAL MULTI MISSION STATIONS FOUR PATROL BOATS AND TWO COAST GUARD LAW ENFORCEMENT DETACHMENTS REFERRED TO AS LEDET S FRONT LINE OUR MARITIME DRUG ENFORCEMENT EFFORT IN THIS AREA UNTIL RECENTLY THE MARITIME AND AIR SMUGGLING OF DRUGS INTO THE GULF COAST REGION WITH THE EXCEPTION THE WEST COAST OF FLORIDA HAS APPARENTLY BEEN ON A MUCH SMALLER SCALE THAN THAT INTO OTHER PARTS THE SOUTHEAST UNITED FOR VARIOUS REASONS THE DRUG SMUGGLERS HAVE TENDED TO FAVOR EITHER CARIBBEAN ROUTES WITH EAST COAST DESTINATIONS OR LAND BORDER CROSSINGS ALONG THE U S SOUTHWEST BORDER LAW ENFORCEMENT STRATEGIES TACTICS AND RESOURCES HAVE BEEN HEAVILY CONCENTRATED ON THOSE TWO MAJOR SMUGGLING CORRIDORS HOWEVER U S INTERDICTION EFFORTS IN THOSE AREAS ARE BECOMING INCREASINGLY SUCCESSFUL AS EVIDENCED BY CHANGING SMUGGLERS * TACTICS TO INCLUDE SMALLER LOADS HIDDEN COMPARTMENTS AND INCREASED AIR SMUGGLING HISTORICALLY DRUG SMUGGLERS HAVE PROVEN TO BE VERY RESOURCEFUL AND FLEXIBLE OFTEN PURSUING THE PATH OF LEAST RESISTANCE AS RECENTLY THREE YEARS AGO MOTHERSHIPS WITH MARIJUANA WOULD FREQUENTLY APPROACH WITHIN SMALL BOAT RANGE THE UNITED TODAY THIS TYPE OF VESSEL RARELY VENTURES NORTH THE YUCATAN CHANNEL RESULT CURRENT TRENDS INDICATE THAT SMUGGLERS HAVE BECOME INCREASINGLY SOPHISTICATED CARRYING SMALLER LOADS ON SMALLER VESSELS SUCCESSFULLY AVOIDING DETECTION AND INTERCEPTION BY COAST GUARD UNITS WITH THEIR SHALLOWER DRAFTS THESE VESSELS OCCASIONALLY SLIP INTO THE TERRITORIAL WATERS ANOTHER COUNTRY IN ORDER TO AVOID OUR UNITS THIS OBVIOUSLY COMPLICATES THE INTERDICTION PROCESS AND WE MUST WORK WITH THE FOREIGN GOVERNMENT TO SUCCESSFULLY PROSECUTE THESE CASES ARE ALSO INDICATIONS THAT CARGO CONTAINER VESSELS ARE BEING USED TO SMUGGLE DRUGS INTO U S PORTS THEREBY AVOIDING EXISTING INLAND BORDER PATROL CHECKPOINTS AND HIGHWAY STOPS IF TRUE THIS COULD MEAN AN INFLUX OF ILLEGAL DRUGS INTO THi GULF RECENT FAVORABLE FUNDING LEVELS AND SUPPLEMENTAL APPROPRIATIONS HAVE ALLOWED ME TO STEP UP LAW ENFORCEMENT PATROLS WHILE STILL CARRYING OUT OTHER COAST GUARD MISSIONS AND PERFORMING NEEDED MAINTENANCE ON COAST GUARD SHORE FACILITIES AND VESSELS SPECIFICALLY SINCE LATE LAST SUMMER WE INCREASED RANDOM LAW ENFORCEMENT PATROLS BY APPROXIMATELY % TO AN AVERAGE OF THREE DAYS PER WEEK FOR EACH THE FIVE COASTAL STATIONS AND FOUR PATROL BOATS WITHIN THE GROUP ADDITIONALLY GROUP MOBILE RECEIVED TWO NEW FOOT " ISLAND CLASS " PATROL BOATS LAST SUMMER THESE ADDITIONAL INTERDICTION ASSETS ENHANCED OUR PATROL CAPABILITY WITH THEIR SPEED AND ENDURANCE THESE NEW PATROL BOATS ADD A NEW DIMENSION TO OUR ENFORCEMENT EFFORT THEY US TO PROJECT A LAW ENFORCEMENT PRESENCE DEEP INTO THE GULF OF MEXICO AND TO REACT FASTER TO MARITIME TACTICAL INTELLIGENCE THE TWO COAST GUARD LEDETS WHOSE PRIMARY MISSION IS TO CONDUCT COAST GUARD BOARDINGS FROM r > U S NAVY SHIPS ALSO AUGMENT GROUP LAW ENFORCEMENT OPERATIONS AND CONDUCT MARITIME LAW ENFORCEMENT TRAINING WHEN NOT DEPLOYED INTERAGENCY COOPERATION FOR DRUG INTERDICTION ACTIVITIES HAS BEEN EXCELLENT AND IS IMPROVING REGULARLY WITH FEDERAL STATE AND LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCY HEADS U S ATTORNEYS IN THE SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF ALABAMA NORTHWEST FLORIDA AND SOUTHERN MISSISSIPPI ARE MOST SUPPORTIVE OUR EFFORTS THE COAST GUARD PLANS AND CARRIES OUT MONTHLY JOINT INTERDICTION OPERATIONS WITH THE U S CUSTOMS SERVICE AND STATE AND LOCAL AGENCIES MY GROUP OPERATIONS CENTER AND FIVE COASTAL STATIONS OPERATE TWENTY DAY ADDITIONALLY WB COORDINATE SOME INSHORE JOINT OPERATIONS WITH THE U S CUSTOMS SERVICE S BLUE LIGHTNING OPERATIONS CENTERS BLOCS IN GULFPORT MISSISSIPPI AND MIAMI FLORIDA OUR SIGNIFICANT LAW ENFORCEMENT PRESENCE PROVIDES A DETERRENT TO DRUG SMUGGLING INTO THE GULF COAST FURTHER THE COMBINATION OF ADDITIONAL ASSETS INCREASED DRUG ENFORCEMENT OPERATIONS AND EXCELLENT COOPERATION WITH OTHER AGENCIES HAVE RESULTED IN TWO SUBSTANTIAL MARIJUANA SEIZURES BY OUR COAST GUARD LEDETS THE PAST YEAR LET ME FINISH BY ASSURING YOU WE WILL MAINTAIN THE " LAST LINE OF DEFENSE " AGAINST THE MARITIME SMUGGLER AND STRIVE TO IMPROVE OUR INTERDICTION EFFORTS EACH DAY BY WORKING TOGETHER WITH OTHER LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES
