THE COMMITTEE ON THE DISTRICT OP COLUMBIA SUBCOMMITTEE ON JUDICIARY AND EDUCATION SEPTEMBER GOOD MORNING MEMBERS OP THE COMMITTEE IT A PLEASURE FOR ME TO BE HERE WITH YOU THIS MORNING TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT DRUG ABUSE ITS PREVENTION IN HIGH SCHOOLS AND COLLEGES IN THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA PROBLEM OF DRUG ABUSE AMONG STUDENTS IN THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA SUBSTANTIAL ONE AND ONE OF CONSIDERABLE CONCERN TO ME THE ADMINISTRATOR THIS CITY S ALCOHOL AND DRUG ABUSE PREVENTION EDUCATION AND REHABILITATION FACILITIES PROBLEM IS SO SERIOUS WE HAVE RECENTLY OPENED LONG TERM RESIDENTIAL FACILITIES TO SPECIFICALLY ADDRESS THE REHABILITATION NEEDS THE CHILDREN THE DISTRICT THERE WE HOPE TO SERVE APPROXIMATELY YOUNG YEAR THESE YOUNG PEOPLE AS SICK THEY ARE ARE THE LUCKY ONES THEY ARE GETTING TREATMENT YOUNG HERE WHO BECOME DRUG INVOLVED DO NOT GET TREATMENT BECAUSE THEY DO NOT SEEK IT DESPITE THE RAVAGES OF THEIR DISEASE THIS APATHY ITSELF A SYMPTOM OF THEIR DISEASE RESULT THEIR FAMILIES HAVE TO LIVE WITH THE EFFECTS THIS DISEASE DISEASE WHICH EXPERTS AOREE IS PRIMARY CHRONIC PROGRESSIVE AND IF NOT TREATED ADEQUATELY TERMINAL WE TOO LIVE WITH THE CONSEQUENCES OF THEIR DISEASE BECAUSE YOU KNOW THERE DIRECT CORRELATION BETWEEN DRUO ABUSE AND CRIME OUR JAILS ARE FULL TO OVERFLOWING WITH YOUNG MEN AND WOMEN CAUGHT * IN CRIMES WHICH THEY COMMITTED A DIRECT RESULT OF THEIR DRUG ABUSE CHIEF TURNER HAS ESTIMATED THAT UP TO % ALL CRIMES ARE DRUG RELATED THIS SEEMS VERY PROBABLE TO US OP ALL ARRESTEES IN THE DISTRICT OP COLUMBIA ARE POUND TO HAVE " DIRTY " URINES THAT THEIR URINES TEST POSITIVE POR DRUGS THE HIGH CRIME RATE COMES ABOUT BECAUSE OP HIGH DRUG RATES PARTICULARLY AMONG THE YOUNG BUT WHY DO YOUNG PEOPLE GET INVOLVED IN DRUGS IN THE FIRST PLACE WE KNOW THE DRUG USE OP OUR YOUNG PEOPLE ANYHOW WE A TOOL WHICH CAN ANSWER SOME OP OUR QUESTIONS ABOUT DRUG ABUSE AMONO DISTRICT STUDENTS IN THE URBAN LEAGUE UNDER CONTRACT TO ADASA CONDUCTED A SURVEY OP DISTRICT STUDENTS LIKE TO SHARE SOME THE RESULTS OP THIS SURVEY WITH YOU AND COMPARE THESE RESULTS AGAINST RESULTS OP SIMILAR SURVEYS OP HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS NATIONWIDE MARIJUANA IN TERMS OF DEMAND THE RESULTS SHOW THAT OUR KIDS IN THE DISTRICT ARE HIGHLY AT RISK THEY ARE USING DRUGS AT RATES CONSIDERABLY ABOVE WHAT IS ALREADY AN APPALLINGLY HIGH NATIONAL RATE NATIONWIDE OP HIGH SCHOOL SENIORS REPORT HAVING USED MARIJUANA OR HASHISH AND THAT DAILY USERS IN THE DISTRICT 68 * OP D C HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS REPORT THAT THEIR BEST HAVE USED MARIJUANA AND * USE IT DAILY THE DISTRICT SURVEY INCLUDES STUDENTS YOUNGER THAN HIOH SCHOOL SENIORS E ., STUDENTS IN THEIR SOPHOMORE AND JUNIOR YEARS AS WELL FRESHMEN IN SOME CASES D C RESULTS ARE LOWER THAN THEY WOULD HAVE BEEN IF ONLY D C SENIORS BEEN SURVEYED THE YOUNGER TEENS MAY NOT AS YET HAVE TRIED DRUGS IF ONLY SENIORS HAD BEEN ASKED AS IN THE NATIONAL SURVEY OUR WOULD HAVE BEEN HIGHER YET M SURE YOU REALIZE IF YOU ASK KIDS THE DRUG AND ALCOHOL USAGE OF THEIR BEST THEY ARE MORE LIKELY TO BE TRUTHFUL THAN IF YOU THEM ABOUT THEIR OWN USAGE !) COCAINE NATIONWIDE * OF HIGH SCHOOL SENIORS HAVE TRIED COCAINE AND * ARE USING IT DAILY IN THIS CITY * ALL SENIOR HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS HAVE TRIED COCAINE AND * USE IT DAILY INCREASINGLY CRACK FORM OF COCAINE WHICH IS BEING USED BECAUSE CRACK IS CHEAP WE CAN EXPECT TO SEE A REAL RISE IN THE STUDENT COCAINE USAGE FIGURES IT IS POTENT AND IT ADDICTS MUCH MORE QUICKLY THAN THE POWDER FORM OF COCAINE THIS MAKES IT TRULY DANGEROUS TO OUR YOUNG PEOPLE PCP DREADFUL DRUG DISGUISED BY SUCH INNOCENT SOUNDINO NAMES AS " LOVELY " AND " LOVE BOAT ". IT IS UNFORTUNATE BUT TRUE THAT IN PROPORTION TO ITS POPULATION SIZE WASHINGTON HIGHEST PCP CAUSED HOSPITAL EMERGENCY RATE IN THE COUNTRY OMINOUSLY IT IS TRULY A DRUG THE YOUNG IN THIS CITY SIXTY PERCENT THE EIGHTEEN YEAR OLDS ARRESTED IN THE DISTRICT AND FOUND TO HAVE DRUGS IN THEIR SYSTEM HAVE TAKEN PCP n PROPORTION GOES DOWN THE AGE OP THE ARRESTEES INCREASES ONLY THE YOUNG ARE FOOLHARDY ENOUGH TO TAKE PCP IP THE YOUNGEST PEOPLE TESTED YEAR OLDS HIGHEST PCP USE RATE WE KNOW ABOUT THEN WE CAN ONLY SPECULATE WHAT KIND OP A DRUG USE RATE THOSE YOUNGER THAN HAVE DID THESE KIDS START USING

THEY IT DAILY IN THIS CITY * OP HIOH SCHOOL SENIORS BEST HAVE TRIED PCP AND * ADMIT IT DAILY IN WARD H * * OP JUNIOR AND SENIOR HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS HAVE BEST PCP THAN HALF OP THE STUDENTS HAVE APPARENTLY USED THIS DANGEROUS MIND BENDING DRUG CONSIDER WARD SEVEN AS WELL WHERE FULLY OP JUNIORS AND SENIORS BEST IT DAILY ALCOHOL FINALLY IN TERMS OP DRINKING BEER OR HARD LIQUOR * OP D C SENIOR HIGH STUDENTS HAVE BEST WHO USE HARD LIQUOR AND BEST WHO USE BEER * WERE SAID TO BE DRINKINQ LIQUOR EVERY DAY AND * WERE DRINKING BEER EVERY DAY CERTAINLY THE CHILDREN WHO USE HARD LIQUOR DAILY ARE EITHER LIKELY TO BECOME OR ARE ALREADY ALCOHOLICS THESE HORRIFYING STATISTICS TELL US WE MAJOR PROBLEM IN ALCOHOL ABUSE ACROSS THIS CITY AMONG OUR CHILDREN AND THAT THE PROBLEM BEGINS VERY YOUNG INDEED OIVEN THAT CONSUMPTION OP ALCOHOL IS ILLEGAL THE AGE OF EIGHTEEN AND THAT MOST SEVENTH GRADE STUDENTS ARE APPROXIMATELY YEARS OF AGE THE PACT THAT OF OUR SEVENTH GRADERS DRINK IS SHOCKING AND HAS SERIOUS IMPLICATIONS FCR THE FUTURE OUR CHILDREN WHEN YOU COUPLE THIS WITH STATISTICS THAT SHOW THAT THE D C CHILDREN BEGAN DRINKING WHEN THEY WERE UNDER ^- ARE CURRENTLY DRINKING A DANGEROUS PATTERN EMERGES CURRENT ALCOHOL USERS BEGAN DRINKING ALCOHOL AT AN EARLIER AGE THAN THOSE WHO STARTED USING ALCOHOL BUT STOPPED A SOMEWHAT SIMILAR PATTERN EXISTS FOR DRUG USERS AND PAST DRUG USERS THE YOUNGER THEY START TO DRINK THE MORE LIKELY THEY ARE TO BECOME ALCOHOLIC ALCOHOL AND DRUGS ACT IN A MORE POWERFUL WAY UPON BODIES THAT ARE JUST ENTERING PASSING THROUGH PUBERTY THAN THEY ON OLDER BODIES THERE A MUCH GREATER RISK A YOUNG PERSON BECOMING ALCOHOL OR DRUG DEPENDENT IF HIS OR HER FIRST EXPERIENCES WITH ALCOHOL AND DRUGS START AT AN EARLY AGE IN FACT THERE DIRECT CORRELATION BETWEEN THE AGE YOUNG PEOPLE START TO DRINK OR USE DRUGS AND THEIR CHANCES BECOMING CHEMICALLY DEPENDENT SIMPLY PUT THE EARLIER THAT DRUGS OR ALCOHOL ARE TRIED THE GREATER THE CHANCE YOUR CHILDREN BECOME DEPENDENT WE DOING WE TO SUCCEED IN BRINGING THE RATE OF SUBSTANCE ABUSE DOWN WE MUST BEGIN WITH YOUNGSTERS THEY TO BE TEENAGERS AND IN THEIR EARLY TEENAGE WHEN THEY THE MOST VULNERABLE WE MUST WORK WITH THEM IN A SERIOUS INTENSIVE APPROPRIATE WAY IP OUR MESSAGE TO BE CREDIBLE THIS ADASA IS PLEDGED TO DO HERE ARE SOME OP THE THINGS WE ARE WORKING ON AT PRESENT THAT ARE OF PARTICULAR BENEFIT TO OUR YOUNG PEOPLE PEER COUNSELING IN SCHOOL DURING THIS SCHOOL YEAR ADASA WORKING TOGETHER WITH THE SCHOOL SYSTEM WILL HAVE STARTED AN IN SCHOOL DRUG EDUCATION PEERCOUNSELING AND REFERRAL PROGRAM WHICH WE EXPECT TO BE VERY SUCCCESS FUL IT WILL GIVE WELL RESPECTED OPPORTUNITY TO BE TRAINED TO BECOME PEER COUNSELORS WITHIN THE SCHOOL SYSTEM WE BELIEVE THAT WITH GOOD TRAINING THEY BE ABLE TO HELP KIDS HEADING INTO TROUBLE TO TURN AWAY IT IS TOO KIDS TALK TO OTHER KIDS MORE EASILY ABOUT THEIR PROBLEMS THAN THEY TO GROWNUPS AND WE WANT TO USE THIS A POSITIVE WAY WE EXPECT OUR PEER COUNSELORS TO SET EXCELLENT BEHAVIOR EXAMPLES AND TO SHOW KIDS WHO ARE FALLING INTO DRUG PRONE LIFESTYLES A BETTER AND MORE REWARDING WAY TO CONDUCT THEIR LIVES WE CAN MODIFY CHILDREN S BEHAVIORS AWAY FROM DRUGS DURING THE MOST VULNERABLE EARLY TEENAGE YEARS PHYSCHOLOOISTS TELL US THE CHANCES OF THEIR GETTING CAUGHT UP IN ALCOHOL OR DRUGS DECREASES WHEN WE FIND A CHILD HAS TURNED OFF INTO DRUGS AND ALCOHOL OUR PROGRAM SET REFERRAL SYSTEM WE WILL WORK WITH THE PARENTS TO IDENTIFY THE MOST APPROPRIATE SOURCE AND KIND OF HELP FOR THE CHILD DEPENDING ON THE EXTENT THE PROGRAM WE WILL ALSO HELP BOTH PARENTS AND SSCHOOL PERSONNEL TO IDENTIFY THE WARNING SIONS OF DRUG OR ALCOHOL USING BEHAVIOR PATTERNS SHORT TERM DETOXIFICATION WE HAVE RECENTLY OPENED A PCP DETOXIFICATION UNIT AT D C GENERAL HOSPITAL WITH BEDS
