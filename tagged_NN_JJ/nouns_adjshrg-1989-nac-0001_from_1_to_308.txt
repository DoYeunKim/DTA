CITIES OVER POPULATION FOR CITIES BETWEEN IT REMAINED AT THE SAME RATE IN NATIONWIDE THE NUMBER OF VIOLENT CRIMES INCREASED FIVE PERCENT FROM TO ALL SERIOUS CRIMES ROSE THREE PERCENT IN THE SAME TIME PERIOD CRACK COCAINE HAS PLAYED THE CENTRAL ROLE IN THE DESTRUCTION OF YOUNG LIVES LURING ADOLESCENTS AND EVEN YOUNGER CHILDREN INTO THE DRUG DEALING BUSINESS GENERATING GANG ACTIVITIES AND TURNING ONCE FRIENDLY NEIGHBORHOODS INTO WAR ZONES THERE HAVE BEEN MANY INDIVIDUAL TRAGEDIES " THE HORRIFYING DEATH OF MARK KILROY AT THE HANDS OF MARIJUANA TRAFFICKERS ON THE TEXAS MEXICO BORDER THE DEATH OF

SAFETY WHICH REPRESENTS PERCENT OF THEIR COLLECTIVE GENERAL FUND BUDGETS IN HOUSTON EXPENDITURES DEDICATED SOLELY TO NARCOTICS ENFORCEMENT HAVE INCREASED NEARLY PERCENT SINCE TIME WHEN OTHER CITY EXPENDITURES DECLINED OR HELD THE LINE IN ADDITION WE KNOW THAT AT LEAST PERCENT THE PEOPLE COMMITTING MAJOR KON DRUG OFFENSES IN HOUSTON WERE ON DRUGS AT THE TIME OF ARREST THIS THE BULK OF OUR LAW ENFORCEMENT DOLLARS ARE AT WORK FIGHTING DRUGS AND RELATED CRIMES WE WILL CONTINUE TO KEEP THIS OUR HIGHEST BUDGET PRIORITY BUT OUR CITIES CANNOT SHOULDER THIS BURDEN ALONE THE NEED FOR DIRECT FEDERAL SUPPORT IS ACUTE TUB SI33ZA1LON IN HOUSTON IN HOUSTON AS IN OTHER CITIES WE ARE SEEING SOME SIGNS OF PROGRESS WE ACHIEVED SMALL GAINS IN NEIGHBORHOODS WHERE COMMUNITY LEADERS HAVE JOINED POLICE OFFICERS TO WAGE WHAT WE HAVE CALLED A CRACKDOWN ON DRUGS WE VE CLEANED DRUG OUT A PARK AND KEPT IT CLEAN FOR YEAR WE VE ERADICATED A MAJOR DRUG DEALING CENTER IN ABANDONED APARTMENTS AND HAVE BEGUN TEARING DOWN THE ABANDONED BUILDINGS WHICH PROVIDE SHELTER FOR DRUG ABUSE AND DRUG MARKETS BUT HOUSTON IS EXHIBITING OTHER FACETS THE DRUG PROBLEM AS WELL WE MARKET OUR CITY A GREAT PLACE TO DO BUSINESS WE A LARGE PORT AND WE RE FIRST IN THE COUNTRY FOR TONNAGE OF INTERNATIONAL CARGO WE TWO EXCELLENT AIRPORTS A GOOD HIGHWAY SYSTEM AND ACCESS TO LATIN AMERICAN MARKETS THE DRUG TRAFFICKERS

DROPPED TO ONE ITS VALUE PAST YEAR MILLION HAVE BEEN SEIZED THROUGH JOINT MONEY LAUNDERING INVESTIGATIONS THE VALUE OF DRUGS SEIZED DURING WAS NEARLY TWICE THAT THE DRUGS SEIZED DURING ARRESTING

CRACKDOWN " IS CHAIRED BY CONGRESSMAN MICKEY LELAND AND INCLUDES ALL SIX MEMBERS OUR CONGRESSIONAL DELEGATION THIS COMMITTEE HAS ALREADY INCREASED HOUSTON S PROFILE WITH FEDERAL AGENCIES AND THE DIRECTOR OF NATIONAL DRUG CONTROL POLICY BUT IF WE TO SUCCEED IN OUR EFFORTS IN HOUSTON THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT S CONTRIBUTION TO AND INVOLVEMENT IN OUR PARTNERSHIP MUST BE INCREASED IMPLEMENTATION THE FEDERAL ANTI DRUG ABUSE GRANT PROGRAMS THE ANTI DRUG ABUSE ACTS REQUIRED THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT THE FIRST TIME TO APPROACH THE PROBLEMS OF ILLEGAL DRUG TRAFFICKING AND ABUSE IN A COMPREHENSIVE MANNER THEY STRENGTHENED FEDERAL INTERDICTION AND ENFORCEMENT EFFORTS STIFFENED MANY FEDERAL PENALTIES AND ESTABLISHED THREE BLOCK GRANT PROGRAMS WHICH PROVIDE FUNDS FOR DRUG EDUCATION TREATMENT AND ENFORCEMENT PROGRAMS YOU WELL AWARE OF SOME THE DIFFICULTIES WE HAVE HAD WITH THESE PROGRAMS THE HAVE BEEN SLOW IN COMING TO OUR CITIES AND OFTEN THEY HAVE NOT GONE TO THOSE AREAS OF GREATEST NEED YOU TO MAKE SEVERAL IMPORTANT CHANGES IN THE DRUG ENFORCEMENT GRANT PROGRAM LAST YEAR IT WAS NOT POSSIBLE TO ENACT A PROVISION THAT WOULD HAVE PROVIDED DIRECT FUNDING TO LOCAL GOVERNMENTS TIGHT DEADLINES WERE PLACED ON THE FOR THEIR ACTIVITIES THESE SEEM TO BE MAKING A DIFFERENCE BUT DIRECT FUNDING WHICH MONEY TO WHERE IT IS NEEDED MOST IN OUR CITIES IS STILL DESPERATELY NEEDED IN PREPARATION THIS HEARING THE CONFERENCE OF MAYORS CONDUCTED A SURVEY TO ASSESS THE CURRENT STATUS THE BLOCK GRANT PROGRAMS FOR ENFORCEMENT TREATMENT AND EDUCATION IT ATTACHED TO MY TESTIMONY AND LIKE TO SUBMIT IT THE RECORD LET ME NOW PROVIDE YOU WITH SOME THE HIGHLIGHTS OF THIS CITX SURVEY O THAN TWO OUT THREE THE SURVEY CITIES BELIEVE THE SYSTEM OF STATE BLOCK GRANTS ESTABLISHED THE ACT IS HSX RESPONSIVE TO THEIR CITY S NEEDS O THAN OUT OF FIVE THE CITIES IN RESPONDSE TO AN OPEN ENDED QUESTION CALLED FOR DIRECT FEDERAL FUNDING OF CITIES OR FOR A SUB STATE FUNDING ENTITLEMENT FOR CITIES TO MAKE THE VARIOUS PROGRAMS MORE RESPONSIVE TO THEIR NEEDS O THAN OUT FOUR CITIES HAVE NEVER PARTICIPATED IN THE DEVELOPMENT THE STATE PLAN FOR ANTI DRUG EDUCATION HALF THE CITIES GAVE THEIR A POOR RATING FOR ADMINISTRATION THE EDUCATION PROGRAM IN TERMS ITS RESPONSIVENESS TO ADDRESSING THEIR LOCAL ILLEGAL DRUG PROBLEM * O MORE THEN FOUR OUT OF FIVE THE CITIES HAVE NEVER PARTICIPATED IN THE DEVELOPMENT THE STATE PLAN FOR TREATMENT SIXTY PERCENT GAVE THEIR A POOR RATING FOR ADMINISTRATION THE TREATMENT BLOCK GRANT IN TERMS OF ITS RESPONSIVENESS TO ADDRESSING LOCAL PROBLEMS O HALF THE CITIES HAVE NEVER PARTICIPATED IN THE DEVELOPMENT THE STATE PLAN FOR ENFORCEMENT FORTY SIX PERCENT THE CITIES GAVE THEIR STATE A POOR RATING FOR ADMINISTRATION THE ENFORCEMENT BLOCK GRANT IN TERMS OF ITS RESPONSIVENESS

PERCENT OUR SURVEY CITIES HAVE YET TO RECEIVE ANY FUNDING FOR ANY YEAR THE ENFORCEMENT ASSISTANCE BLOCK GRANT PROGRAM STATE BLOCK GRANT SYSTEM FOR NARCOTICS ENFORCEMENT FUNDING IS HELPFUL IN ADDRESSING STATEWIDE CONCERNS IT FALLS FAR SHORT OF ASSISTING US IN THE CITIES WHERE THE NATION S DRUG PROBLEMS ARE MOST INTENSE IN TEXAS FOR EXAMPLE OUR DRUG PROBLEM IS MULTI FACETED WE A LONG BORDER WITH MEXICO WE VAST RURAL AREAS WHERE DRUGS CAN BE SAFELY MANUFACTURED AND WHERE EVERY OFFICER IS KNOWN ON A FIRST NAME BASIS MAKING UNDERCOVER WORK IMPOSSIBLE IN THIS SAME STATE THE FOURTH LARGEST CITY IN THE COUNTRY A CITY WHICH RAPIDLY BECOMING A MAJOR NARCOTICS TRAFFICKING CENTER AN UNDER FUNDED STATE BLOCK GRANT CANNOT ADDRESS THIS BROAD RANGE OF PROBLEMS AT " THERE IS STILL A CLEAR NEED FOR CHANGES TO THE FEDERAL PROGRAM — CHANGES WHICH ENSURE FUNDS ARE PROVIDED TO THOSE AREAS OF GREATEST NEED AND WITH ALL POSSIBLE SPEED THE CUMBERSOME GRANT PROGRAM WHICH WAS ESTABLISHED DOES NOT RESPOND TO THE URGENCY THE SITUATION WHICH WE FACE IN OUR CITIES WE LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH YOU TO RECTIFY THIS SITUATION THE CONFERENCE OF MAYORS * NATIONAL ANTI PKTC STRATEGY THE CONFERENCE OF

WHICH INCLUDE THE USE THE MILITARY IN ILLEGAL DRUG INTERDICTION OUTSIDE OF U S LAND AREA THE PROVISION OF NEEDED EQUIPMENT AND THE DEVELOPMENT OF NEW TECHNOLOGIES WHICH INCREASE THE SUCCESS THESE EFFORTS O A DRAMATIC INCREASE IN THE FEDERAL FUNDING AVAILABLE TO LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT AND THE PROVISION OF THOSE FUNDS DIRECTLY TO CITIES WITHOUT REQUIRING MATCHING FUNDS O AN INCREASE IN THE JAIL AND PRISON SPACE AVAILABLE THROUGH INCREASED FEDERAL FUNDING FOR JAIL CONSTRUCTION AND THE USE OF AVAILABLE APPROPRIATE FEDERAL INSTALLATIONS O DEVELOPMENT A FEDERAL STATE AND LOCAL PARTNERSHIP TO PROVIDE DRUG TREATMENT TO ANYONE SEEKING ACCESS TO IT THE FOLLOWING PROVISIONS WERE ADDED BY THE MAYORS AND POLICE CHIEFS THIS YEAR ♦ THE NATIONAL WAR ON DRUGS MUST BE OFFICIALLY DECLARED THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT MUST MOBILIZE ACCORDINGLY MUST UNDERTAKE THE NECESSARY STRATEGIC PLANNING AND MUST COMMIT THE RESOURCES NEEDED TO WIN THIS WAR MANUFACTURE AND IMPORTATION OF SEMI AUTOMATIC ASSAULT WEAPONS

AND EFFECTIVELY IN THE AREAS WHERE THEY ARB NEEDED MOST o FUNDING THE VARIOUS COMPONENTS THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM — IN PARTICULAR PROSECUTIONS COURTS AND CORRECTIONS — MUST BE INCREASED SO THAT PENALTIES FOR POSSESSION TRAFFICKING AND OTHER CRIMES CAN BE STRICTLY ENFORCED O THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT MUST RECOGNIZE ITS RESPONSIBILITY FOR ADDRESSING ADEQUATELY THE PROBLEMS OF POVERTY UNEMPLOYMENT DISINTEGRATING NEIGHBORHOODS AND OTHER SOCIAL ILLS — PROBLEMS THE ROOT CAUSES THE INSATIABLE DEMAND FOR DRUGS IN THIS NATION o A HIGHER PRIORITY MUST BE GIVEN TO DRUG ABUSE EDUCATION AT ALL LEVELS THE
