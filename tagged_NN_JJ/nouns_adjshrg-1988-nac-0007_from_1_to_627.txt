THUS FAR NATIONAL EFFORTS SHOULD ONLY BE REALISTICALLY REFERRED TO A " SKIRMISH " THE RESOURCES NEEDED FOR A WAR HAVE NOT BEEN MADE AVAILABLE IN YEAR BUDGET AUTHORITY FOR DEFENSE SPENDING EXCEEDS BILLION IN COMPARISON WITH A LITTLE OVER BILLION IN BUDGET AUTHORITY FOR FEDERAL LAW ENFORCEMENT EFFORTS IF WE FACTOR IN BUDGET AUTHORITY FOR MANY OP THE HUMAN SUPPORT PROGRAMS THAT ARE VIEWED INSTRUMENTAL IN PREVENTING DRUG ABUSE SUCH AS HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES BILLION ), HOUSING AND URBAN DEVELOPMENT BILLION ), AND EDUCATION BILLION THE TOTAL COMBINED BUDGETS BILLION DO NOT MATCH THE AMOUNT AUTHORIZED FOR DEFENSE SPENDING CLEARLY A REORDERING OUR NATIONAL PRIORITIES IS NEEDED IF WE TO MAKE A NOTICEABLE DENT IN THE DRUG MARKET NUMEROUS HOURS THINKING ABOUT BOTH THE CAUSES AND ♦ POSSIBLE SOLUTIONS TO THE DRUG PROBLEM HAVE DEFINITIVE ANSWERS CONVINCED WE HAVE NOT DISSECTED THE ISSUE INTO SEPARATE COMPONENTS THAT WILL MAKE THE OVERALL PROBLEM MORE AMENABLE TO ANALYSIS WE TEND TO TAKE A HOLISTIC VIEW OF DRUGS AND CRIME BUT AS IT ARE FIVE DISTINCT CATEGORIES OF PEOPLE FOR WHOM TREATMENT LAW ENFORCEMENT AND PREVENTION POLICIES MUST BE DIRECTED PIRST THE INDIVIDUAL WHO PHYSIOLOGICAL AND / OR PSYCHOLOGICAL ADDICTION TO DRUGS SHOULD BE VIEWED A MEDICAL PROBLEM AND TREATED AS SUCH AS LONG CRIMINAL LAWS ARE NOT VIOLATED IN ACQUISITION THE TO PURCHASE ILLEGAL DRUGS WE SHOULD NOT USE SCARCE CRIMINAL JUSTICE RESOURCES IN PURSUIT THIS TYPE OF INDIVIDUAL SECOND THERE A CATEGORY OF OFFENDER WHO INITIALLY ONLY t USED DRUGS BUT RESORTED TO CRIMINAL ACTIVITY TO OBTAIN MONEY NEEDED TO PURCHASE THE DRUGS FOR WHICH A PHYSICAL DEPENDENCE HAD DEVELOPED THIS TYPE OF PERSON S GREATEST NEED IS FOR MEDICAL INTERVENTION ACCOMPANIED BY CLOSE MONITORING TO ASSURE THAT PRESCRIBED TREATMENT ROUTINES ARE BEING FOLLOWED ALSO FOR THIS OFFENDER NON INCARCERATIVE SANCTIONS THAT ALLOW FOR RESTITUTION SHOULD BE EXPLORED WHEN THE OFFENSES DO NOT INVOLVE VIOLENCE THE THIRD CATEGORY INVOLVES THE MID LEVEL STREET DEALER WHO NOT ADDICTED OCCASIONALLY USES DRUGS STIFF CRIMINAL PENALTIES SHOULD BE IMPOSED POR THIS TYPE OP OPPENDER WITH AN EMPHASIS ON BREAKING THE CADRE OP SELLERS AND BUYERS WITH WHOM HE SHE INTERACTS BECAUSE RECENT TRENDS SUGGEST A SHIFT TOWARDS MORE VIOLENCE ASSOCIATED WITH THE DRUG TRADE PREVIOUSLY DRUG USE AND SALES WERE CLOSELY RELATED TO THE COMMISSION OP PROPERTY CRIMES SUCH BURGLARY AND LARCENY CURRENTLY DRUG TURF BATTLES RAGE BECAUSE OP THE TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OP PROPIT REALIZED PROM DRUG SALES COROLLARY INCREASE IN HOMICIDES AND ASSAULTS HAS TRANSFORMED STREETS IN MANY URBAN AREAS TO ASPHALT BATTLE GROUNDS MANY OP THESE VIOLENT ACTS INVOLVE THE USE FIREARMS THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA HAS VERY STRICT FIREARMS REGISTRATION LEGISLATION BUT UNTIL NEIGHBORING THE NATIONAL GOVERNMENT IMPLEMENT POLICIES AND LAWS GOVERNING WIDESPREAD PURCHASE AND POSSESSION OP FIREARMS IT WILL BE DIFFICULT TO STEM THE VIOLENCE ASSOCIATED WITH ILLEGAL DRUG SALES THE FOURTH CATEGORY THE OBJECT OP MY EXTREME IRE AND LABEL THEM " INTERNATIONAL DRUG THUGS THESE ARE THE HIGH LEVEL ENTREPRENEURS WHO IMPORT THESE KILLER SUBSTANCES INTO OUR COUNTRY AND MAKE MILLIONS PROM THEIR SALE OPERATING UNDER A CLOAK OP RESPECTABILITY THESE ARE INDIVIDUALS FOR WHOM A WELL COORDINATED COMPREHENSIVE PEDERAL POLICY MOST NEEDED IP WE ARE TO REALIZE ANY MEANINGFUL IMPACT ON THE UNLIMITED SUPPLY OF DRUGS COMING INTO OUR COUNTRY TO DESTROY THE SUCCESSFUL OPERATIONS THESE " INTERNATIONAL DRUG THUGS " MANDATES STRONG LEADERSHIP AND CENTRAL OVERSIGHT AT THE NATIONAL LEVEL BANKS OTHER FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS MUST HELD ACCOUNTABLE FOR THEIR TACIT COOPERATION WITH THESE CROOKS BY HELPING THEM LAUNDER MONEY AND OTHER ASSETS OBTAINED THROUGH THEIR ILLEGAL ACTIVITIES ADDITIONALLY MEASURES MUST BE BY THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT TO MAKE IT MORE DIFFICULT POR ILLEGALLY OBTAINED FUNDS TO BE SENT OUT THE COUNTRY AND USED AS COLLATERAL TO FURTHER SUPPORT HIGHLY SOPHISTICATED INTERNATIONAL DRUG RINGS THIS LEVEL IS WHERE THE PROFIT MOTIVE IS STRONGEST WE MUST EXERCISE DIFFFERENT STRATEGIES FOR TAKING THE PROFIT OUT OF DRUG DEALING PURTHERMORB THESE " INTERNATIONAL DRUG THUGS " ARE APPREHENDED AND CONVICTED WE MUST TAKE STRIDENT STEPS TO ENSURE THEY DO NOT CONTINUE TO DIRECT THEIR OPERATIONS PROM PRISON THEY SHOULD BE BARRED PROM HAVING CONTACT WITH THEIR FORMER ACCOMPLLICES WHO OFTEN CONTINUE TO MANAGE THE ILLEGAL OPERATIONS ADMINISTRATIVE AND BUDGETARY OVERSIGHT IS FRAGMENTED FOR DRUG CONTROL FUNCTIONS CURRENTLY THREE SEPARATE DEPARTMENTS OP THE U S GOVERNMENT ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR FEDERAL INTERDICTION TREASURY TRANSPORATION AND JUSTICE FURTHERMORE THE AGENCIES WITHIN THOSE DEPARTMENTS CUSTOMS COAST GUARD AND DRUG ENFORCEMENT ADMINISTRATION DEA HAVE DIFFERENT PROGRAMS GOALS AND PRIORITIES ALSO THERE NO UNIFIED BUDGET AND VERY LITTLE FACTUAL INFORMATION THE EFFECTIVENESS OF ANTI DRUG PROGRAMS THE ISSUES OF PROGRAM EFFECTIVENESS LEADS ME TO THE PTFTH \ CATEGORY THAT REQUIRES OUR ATTENTION THE YOUNG PEOPLE WHO SELL DRUGS BUT DO NOT USE THEM THEY CURRENTLY POSE ONE THE GREATEST CHALLENGES TO LOCAL OFFICIALS WHO ARE GRAPPLING WITH WAYS TC SHAPE ATTITUDES CHANGE VALUES FROM THE MATERIALISTIC FOCUS OF YOUTH WHO SEE SELLING DRUGS THE KEY TO MANHOOD WEALTH AND SUCCESS OF COURSE THESE YOUTH MUST BE REMOVED FROM THE STREETS AND PREVENTED FROM ENGAGING IN ILLEGAL ACTIVITIES HOWEVER THE BIGGER QUESTION IS " HOW DO WE DISCOURAGE DRUG USE AND SALES AND PROMOTE THE ADpPTION OF VALUES THAT THE WORK ETHIC EDUCATIONAL ACHIEVEMENT AND SOCIAL ENLIGHTMENT WE KNOW THE USE OF COCAINE HEROIN AND MARIJUANA ALL HAVE DELETERIOUS EFFECTS ON THE BODY WE KNOW FULL WELL THE DAMAGE CREATED BY DRUG USAGE ON THE UNBORN CHILD BABIES BORN WITH LOW BIRTH WEIGHTS TO MOTHERS WHO USED DRUGS DURING PREGNANCY THE POTENTIAL FOR TEMPORARY AND PERMANENT DAMAGE TO THE BRAIN IMPAIRED MEMORY PERCEPTION AND JUDGEMENT WE ALSO KNOW THAT MANY DRUG WITH ALCOHOLISM % OF COCAINE ADDICTS AT PRESENT BECOME ALCOHOLIC AND IT IS ESTIMATED % NARCOTICS ABUSERS DEVELOP ALCOHOL DEPENDENCY PROBLEMS PURTHERMORE % OP THE NATION S DRINKERS ARB ALCOHOLIC % HORB OP ALL REGULAR ILLICIT DRUG USERS BECOME ADDICTED DUE TO THE SEVERE HEALTH SOCIAL PSYCHOLOGICAL AND ECONOMIC PROBLEMS THAT ACCOMPANY DRUG ABUSE THE DISTRICT GOVERNMENT HAS ALSO INCREASED RESOURCES AND SERVICES FOR PERSONS WHO ARE NOT DIRECTLY INVOLVED IN THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM IN THE DISTRICT S EXPENDITURES FOR DRUG PREVENTION TOTALLED PLANNED EXPENDITURES FOR FY ARE A FORTY PERCENT INCREASE IN ADDITION A NEW DELINQUENCY PREVENTION PROGRAM CALLED " INVEST IN OUR FUTURE * WHICH A BROAD BASED APPROACH TO PREVENT YOUTH FROM BECOMING INVOLVED IN THE JUVENILE JUSTICE SYSTEM THE ALCOHOL DRUG ABUSE SERVICES ADMINISTRATION ADASA PROVIDES PRIMARY AND COMMUNITY BASED SUBSTANCE ABUSE PREVENTION PROGRAMS ADASA THE D C PUBLIC SCHOOLS WORK TOGETHER IN PROVIDING PRIMARY i SUBSTANCB ABUSE PREVENTION PROGRAMS O C PUBLIC SCHOOLS HAVE ALSO USED A GRANT UNDER THE ANTI DRUG ACT TO ESTABLISH A SUSTANCE ABUSE OFFICE IN THE O C PUBLIC SCHOOLS THE DISTRICT S DRUG TREATMENT PROGRAMS HAVE GROWN DRAMATICALLY IN FY EXPENDITURES FOR DRUG TREATMENT TOTALLED BUT IN FY THE DISTRICT PLANS TO SPEND AN % INCREASE r NOW ACCESSIBILITY TO TREATMENT FOR LESS THAN PERCENT THOSE WHO IT IN THE DISTRICT THIS CONSISTENT WITH SIMILAR NATIONAL FIGURES BUT TO PROVIDE TREATMENT TO THAT SMALL FRACTION OF THOSE IN NEED COSTS THAN MILLION EACH YEAR IN THE DISTRICT OTHER COSTS NOT CONSIDERED ARE IN DRUG RELATED AUTOMOBILE ACCIDENTS REDUCED PRODUCTIVITY LOST EMPLOYMENT AND DRUG RELATED DEATHS NOT TO MENTION THE HEALTH CARE COSTS CITED EARLIER COST BE CALCULATED THE GRIEP AND STRESS UPON FAMILY AND LOVED ONES OF THOSE WHO ABUSE DRUGS DRUG ABUSE DISEASE THAT INFECTS THOSE DIRECTLY INVOLVED AND ADVERSELY IMPACTS THOSE CLOSE TO THE USER IN ORDER TO REALLY COMBAT THESE SERIOUS PROBLEMS THE CONGRESS MUST INSIST UPON AND FUND MAJOR RESEARCH PROGRAMS TO DETERMINE WHAT IS NEEDED FOR LONG TERM TREATMENT OF COCAINE AND PCP ADDICTION WE DON T t KNOW ENOUGH ABOUT HOW TO TREAT PERSONS ADDICTED TO EITHER THESE DRUGS NATIONAL LEADERS MUST IMPLORE THE BEST MEDICAL PSYCHIATRIC AND SOCIAL POLICY EXPERTS OUR ERA TO EXAMINE THIS ISSUE AND DEVELOP TREATMENT PROTOCOLS CONCERNED THE ACTIONS RECENTLY TAKEN BY THE U S HOUSE REPRESENTATIVES WITH REGARD TO THE " OMNIBUS DRUG INITIATIVE ACT " H R THE TONE THE DEBATE AND THE VOTES ON FLOOR AMENDMENTS IS ONE WHICH NOT ELIMINATE DRUG ABUSE IN THIS NATION LEGAL SANCTIONS SUCH THE DEATH PENALTY DENIAL OF C8RTAIN FEDERAL BENEPITS CHANGES IN THE EXCLUSIONARY RULE TO PERMIT INTRODUCTION OF EVIDENCE IN FEDERAL CRIMINAL CASES AND STRONG PENALTIES FOR SIMPLE POSSESSION NOT DETER DRUG ABUSE IN THIS COUNTRY THESE AMENDMENTS SEEK TO PUNISH THE USER AND NOT THE TYPE OF LARGE DRUG DEALERS SPOKE EARLIER WE CANNOT LEGISLATE AWAY THE MEDICAL AND PSYCHOLOGICAL PROBLEM OF DRUG ADDICTION OBVIOUSLY THERE NO SIMPLE ANSWER BUT FIRMLY BELIEVE THE WAR CAN BE WON TO DATE WE ADDRESSED OUR SUBSTANCE ABUSE EFFORTS THOUGH WE WERE PREPARING FOR A BATTLE NOT A WAR WE OBSELSTE TECHNIQUES AND TECHNOLOGY WE WORLD WAR II STRATEGY FOR A VIETNAM TYPE WAR WE CAN DEVELOP " STAR WARS " TECHNOLOGY TO PROTECT OUR BORDERS WE CAN DETERMINE WHERE UNDERGROUND MISSILES ARE STORED FROM SATELLITES MILLIONS OF MILES IN OUTER SPACE SOMETHING SIMILAR CAN PERHAPS BE DESIGNED TO DETECT THE CULTIVATION OF DRUGS IN OTHER COUNTRIES THIS CHALLENGE IS NOT TOO GREAT A

national drug problem difficult insurmountable certain Washington D C Charles Town West Virginia emerge victorious TESTIMONY OP EDWARD KOCH MAYOR OP THE CITY OF NEW YORK THE HOUSE SELECT COMMITTEE ON NARCOTICS ABUSE AND CONTROL SEPTEMBER WASHINGTON D C GOOD MORNING CHAIRMAN RANGEL CONGRESSMAN GILMAN AND DISTINGUISHED MEMBERS OP THE SELECT COMMITTEE LET ME BEGIN BY CONGRATULATING YOU ALL ON LAST WEEK S PASSAGE THE OMNIBUS DRUG BILL IT IS LARGELY YOUR HANDIWORK AND YOU TO BE COMMENDED NORMALLY PREFACE MY REMARKS BY SAYING THAT M GLAD TO BE HERE BUT TODAY THAT NOT THE CASE GIVEN DEVASTATION THAT DRUGS HAVE WROUGHT ON OUR COMMUNITIES AND NATION PARTICULARLY THE LAST FEW YEARS IT ASTOUNDING THAT HERE TO DISCUSS A NOTION THAT SEEMS TO ME TO BE THE EQUIVALENT OF EXTINGUISHING A RAGING FIRE WITH NAPALM FIRE AT THIS VERY MOMENT IS FRYING THE BRAINS OF THOUSANDS OF AMERICANS MR CHAIRMAN THIS COMMITTEE ALONG WITH THE VERY ACTIVE SUPPORT THE VAST MAJORITY OF AMERICA S MAYORS HAS MADE VALIANT EFFORTS IN THE PAST FEW YEARS TO DEVISE WAYS TO COMBAT THE DRUG SCOURGE THAT CONTINUES TO TEAR AT OUR NATION TODAY A SMALL SMALL NUMBER IN THESE RANKS ARE UNWITTINGLY IMPEDING OUR PROGRESS BY SUGGESTING THAT W £ WAVE THE WHITE FLAG IN THE WAR ON DRUGS AND SUCCUMB TO THE ENEMY IS THEIR VISION THE FUTURE THIS COUNTRY NOTHING BETTER THAN OF ITS BECOMING A B ANN ANA REPUBLIC HOPE NOT BUT SURELY THAT WHERE THEIR PROPOSITION WOULD LEAD US FROM ALONE IN FEELING THIS WAY THE SEPTEMBER NEW YORK TIMES REPORTED THAT AN ABC NEWS POLL THAN % THE AMERICAN PUBLIC REJECT DECRIMINALIZING ALL ILLICIT DRUGS THEY ALSO BELIEVE BY A TO RATIO LEGALIZATION OF DRUGS WOULD LEAD TO AN INCREASE IN CRIME YET IN PART BECAUSE THE FRUSTRATION SOME HAVE HAD WITH THE DIFFICULT TASK ADDRESSING THE DRUG PROBLEM THE IDEA OF LEGALIZATION HAS BEEN ELEVATED UNDESERVEDLY TO A PLACE WITHIN THE REALM OF DEBATABLE IF NOT POTENTIAL POLICY ALTERNATIVES NOW IT IS THERE IT MAY IN FACT BE NECESSARY TO PUT THE QUESTION OF LEGALIZATION ON THE TABLE BUT ONLY TO PUT IT TO REST SO WE CAN MOVE FORWARD WITH THE STRATEGIES THAT WILL HAVE AN IMPACT LET ME CITE SOME STATISTICS WHICH REVEAL THE DIMENSION AND IMPACT THE DRUG PROBLEM ARE OVER HEROIN IN THIS COUNTRY AND SIX MILLION WHO A SERIOUS COCAINE OR CRACK ABUSE PROBLEM TROUBLING THE INCREASING NUMBERS OUR YOUTH WHO ARE ABUSING CERTAIN DRUGS ALTHOUGH NO ONE KNOWS FOR CERTAIN THE NUMBER OF JUVENILES USING DRUGS SURVEYS OF HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS HAVE SHOWN DRAMATIC INCREASES IN THEIR USE OF COCAINE THE LAST TEN YEARS THB DEVASTATING ZU PBCTS OF DRUG ABU98 AlID DRUO TRAFFICK ZNG SUPPLIES THX ABUSERS WITH THEIR POISON ARE QUITE CLEAR RELIABLE HAVE CONCLUDED THAT DRUO ABUSE AND DRUG TRAFFICKERS ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR MUCH THE VIOLENT CRIME IN OUR NATION THESE ASSERTIONS ARE SUPPORTED BY DATA FROM THE NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF JUSTICE S DRUG FORECASTING SURVEY WHICH RECENTLY IN NEW YORK CITY % THE SURVEYED ARRESTEES TESTED POSITIVE FOR AT LEAST ONE DRUG INCLUDING MARIJUANA % TESTED POSITIVE FOR COCAINE INCLUDING CRACK AND % TESTED POSITIVE FOR HEROIN INDEED THE NEW YORK CITY POLICE DEPARTMENT HAS ARRESTED ALMOST FOR DRUG RELATED CRIME THE LAST TWO YEARS % FROM TO AND % IN THE FIRST FIVE MONTHS THIS DATA CLEARLY UNDERSCORES THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN DRUG ABUSE AND CRIME IT IS UNDENIABLE THAT IF WE DO NOT REDUCE DRUG ABUSE ITS RESULTING CRIME AND OTHER DESTRUCTIVE PHYSIOLOGICAL CONSEQUENCES WILL CONTINUE TO ESCALATE AND WILL RESULT IN A NATIONAL TRAGEDY OF MUCH GREATER PROPORTIONS THAN IT IS TODAY SUGGESTION WE SHOULD LEGALIZE DRUGS IS THEREFORE ALL THE MORE SHOCKING HOW WOULD LEGALIZATION REDUCE DRUG ABUSE ITS RESULTING DEVASTATION AND CRIME LET S ANALYZE THE LEGALIZATION ARGUMENTS TO START WITH SOME WOULD HAVE US BELIEVE THE LAWS AGAINST DRUG USB AND DRUG TRAFFICKING ARE PROHIBITIONS AGAINST A MANNER OF PERSONAL CONDUCT OR STYLE THEY THE IMPOSITION OF SOCXftTY S MORAL VALUES ON THE INDIVIDUAL THIS JUST NOT THE CASE RATHER THEY ARE LAWS THAT PROHIBIT CONDUCT WHICH DESTROYS NOT ONLY THE INDIVIDUAL USERS BUT THEIR FAMILIES THE INNOCENT VICTIMS OF THEIR CRIMES AND THE VERY FOUNDATION A PRODUCTIVE SOCIETY PROPONENTS OF LEGALIZATION ARE WEAK ON THE SPECIFICS THE IMPLEMENTATION A POLICY OF " DRUGS FOR ALL ". SOKE SUGGEST GOVERNMENT SHOULD PLAY A " BIG BROTHER " ROLE PROVIDING FIXED DOSES TO ADDICTS AND THEREBY LIMITING DRUG USE THEIR LACK UNDERSTANDING OF DRUG ABUSE IS STARTLING SINCE THERE NO SUCH THING A FIXED DOSE THAT WILL SATISFY A DRUG ADDICT S APPETITE FOR GREATER AND GREATER QUANTITIES ACCORDINGLY THE BLACK MARKET LEGALIZERS SAY BE ELIMINATED WOULD OF NECESSITY EXIST TO PROVIDE AN ADDITIONAL AVENUE OF OBTAINING THAT WHICH NOT AVAILABLE FROM " LEGITIMATE " SOURCES PIGGY BACKING ASSERTION THAT LEGALIZATION WILL ELIMINATE THE HIGH PROFIT MARGINS ON DRUG SALES AND THEREFORE THE BLACK MARKET PROPONENTS SAY THAT CRIME ASSOCIATED WITH DRUG TRAFFICKING WILL DIMINISH ONCE DRUGS BECOME AN ACCEPTABLE COMMODITY THEY IGNORE HISTORY AND THE FACTS CHEAP DRUGS WON T REDUCE CRIME THEY NEVER IN FACT GIVEN ENGLAND S DESPERATE FAILURE TO RELIEVE ITS HEROIN ADDICTION PROBLEM THROUGH HEROIN DISTRIBUTION PROGRAMS DURING THE * OPPOSITE IS CLOSER TO THE TRUTH UNTIL HEROIN WAS FREELY PRESCRIBED IN BRITAIN BY PRIVATE DOCTORS BUT OVER PRESCRIPTION LED TO A DOUBLING THE ADDICTED POPULATION BETWEEN AND THEN IT TOOK OFF CHEAP HEROIN FROM PAKISTAN WHICH SOLD FOR A FIX ON THE STREET BEGAN FLOODING THE BLACK MARKET NOT ONLY IT SUPER CHEAP IT WAS MORE POTENT THAN GOVERNMENT WAS HANDING OUT AND CAME WITHOUT BUREAUCRATIC RESTRICTIONS CHEAP POTENT AND HASSLE FREE THE NEW STREET HEROIN QUADRUPLED THE NUMBER OF ADDICTS IN YEARS BY THE BRITISH HOME OFFICE ESTIMATED THERE WERE TO HEROIN ADDICTS IN THE COUNTRY SOME UNOFFICIAL WERE THREE TIMES GREATER HOW WAS CRIME IN BRITAIN AFFECTED BY LEGALIZATION IN STUDY % THE ADDICTS IN GOVERNMENT PROGRAMS WERE CONVICTED OF CRIMES IN THEIR FIRST YEAR OF PARTICIPATION UNEMPLOYMENT AMONG ADDICTS REMAINED CHRONIC TOO AS DID OTHER KINDS OF DRUG USE % THE ADDICTS REGISTERED WITH THE GOVERNMENT WERE FOUND TO USE OTHER ILLICIT DRUGS AS WELL ALL TOLD THE GOVERNMENT PROGRAM WAS A DISASTER ANOTHBR FACET THE CRIME PROBLEM ASSOCIATED WITH DRUGS THAT FREQUENTLY OVERLOOKED A NUMBER OF DRUGS AND CRACK IN PARTICULAR HAVE BEEN SHOWN TO HAVE BEHAVIORAL EFFECTS THAT RESULT IN VIOLENT CRIMINAL CONDUCT NOT LIMITED TO THEFT TO OBTAIN MONEY TO PURCHASE DRUGS DON T THINK WE WOULD BE TOO FAR FROM THE MARK BY ASSUMING THE EMERGING ’’ DESIGNER ” DRUGS WOULD HAVE SIMILAR EFFECTS THE DRUG SELLERS SEARCH A PRODUCT THAT GIVES QUICKER AND MORE INTENSE HIGHS SHOULD THE GOVERNMENT DISTRIBUTE OR CONDONE THESE CRIME INDUCING DRUGS TOO PERMITTING DRUG USE AND ENCOURAGING EVEN GREATER DRUG USE BY LEGALIZATION WOULD PERPETUATE AND EXPAND THE DEVASTATING EFFECTS OF DRUG ABUSE ITS RESULTING CRIME ANOTHER ERRONEOUS ARGUMENT FOR LEGALIZATION IS BASED ON THE ECONOMIC RATIONALE THAT XT WOULD BE CHEAPER TO PROVIDE DRUGS TO ADDICTS THAN IT TO ENFORCE THE LAWS AND PURSUE ANTI DRUG STRATEGIES IT WOULD NOT BE CHEAPER DRUG USING POPULATION INCREASES THE COSTS TO SOCIETY FOR THE CRIME AND OTHER DETRIMENTAL HEALTH EFFECTS OF DRUG ABUSE WOULD BE FAR GREATER THAN THEY ARE NOW WE WOULD STILL REQUIRE THE POLICE COURTS PROSECUTORS AMD JAILS TO DEAL WITH DRUG RELATED CRIME WE WOULD NEED TO DRAMATICALLY INCREASE TREATMENT PROGRAMS FOR THOSE WHO ON DRUGS WANT TO GET OFF WE WOULD STILL HAVE THE ECONOMIC IMPACT ON BUSINESS NOT ONLY IN TERMS LOST PRODUCTIVITY BUT IN TERMS OF INCREASED HEALTH CARE INSURANCE WORKER SAFTEY AND UNEMPLOYMENT BENEFITS KVEM IF XT X EXPENSIVE TO WHAT WX ARE DOING TO ERADICATE THIS PROBLEM CAN GOVERNMENT S OBLIGATION TO PROTECT THE PUBLIC SAFETY BE ABDICATED IT IS EXPENSIVE CLEARLY NOT TWO WEEKS AGO ON A NATIONWIDE TELEVISION BROADCAST ON THIS SAME TOPIC IT WAS SUGGESTED THAT ANTI DRUG LAW ENFORCEMENT EFFORTS NOW ESTIMATED AT BILLION NATIONWIDE COULD BE CUT TO BILLION IF DRUGS WERE LEGALIZED HOW WE SAY IT BILLION IS TOO MUCH TO SPEND HOW MUCH IS TOO MUCH YEAR Z READ IN THE WASHINGTON POST THAT LEADERS THE INFAMOUS MEDELLIN DRUG CARTEL OFFERRED TO PAY OFF COLUMBIA ’ S ESTIMATED US BILLION NATIONAL DEBT IN RETURN FOR IMMUNITY FROM PROSECTUTION AND THE SCRAPPING THE COUNTRY S EXTRADITION TREATY WITH THE U S THIS HANDFUL INDIVIDUALS WERE WILLING TO SPEND ALMOST TWICE W HUGH TO STAY IN THE GAME THAN WE AT MILLION STRONG ARB TO KEEP THEM OUT IT IS ALL TOO PAINFULLY OBVIOUS BILLION IS NOT NEARLY ENOUGH AND WE NEED TO COMMIT MORE THE RIGHT PLACES PART OUR PROBLEM HAS BEEN A LACK OP NATIONAL COMMITMENT NOT THE PART THE AVERAGE AMERICAN BUT BY THOSE WHO REPRESENTING THEM THE TOUGH CHOICES BE ARE NOT BEING MADE THE OMNIBUS DRUG BILL AUTHORIZED MILLION FOR DRUG LAW ENFORCEMENT ONLY MILLION WAS ACTUALLY APPROPRIATED WHY MOST COMMON EXCUSE THERE S NO MORE MONEY ANYTHING SINCE GRAMM RUDMAN LET S FACE IT UNLESS WX FIND A NEW REVENUE STREAM FOR FUNDING ANTI NARCOTICS EFFORTS WE MAY NEVER BE ABLE TO ADEQUATELY ADDRESS OUR NEEDS Dumber past year i year federal income tax surcharge ELIMINATING THE DRUG PROBLEM THE AMERICAN PUBLIC WOULD SUPPORT SUCH A TAX IF IT WERE PROPOSED IN THIS CONTEXT HOWEVER IN THIS ELECTION YEAR EVERYONE IN WASHINGTON LOATHE TO MENTION THAT T " WORD FOR ANY PURPOSE TERRIBLY SHORTSIGHTED NOW M NOT THROWING THE ENTIRE BURDEN IN THE LAP THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT BUT YOU LL AGREE WHETHER IT S LOS ANGELES NEW YORK UTICA OR TOPEKA ON ITS OWN A CITY CAN T WIN THE WAR ON DRUGS WASHINGTON MUST DO ITS JOB TOO THE CITIES ARE ALREADY DOING THEIR PART NEW YORK CITY IN PARTICULAR IS DEDICATED TO DO WHATEVER IT CAN IN TERMS FIGHTING THE DRUG WAR WITH DEDICATED SOLELY TO NARCOTICS INTERDICTION WE SPENDING NEARLY HALF A BILLION DOLLARS IN CITY MONEY TO ADDRESS ALL ASPECTS OF DRUG CONTROL BUT DO BUILDING THE SUCCESS A SPECIAL POLICE UNIT WE ORGANIZED LAST SPRING THE " TACTICAL NARCOTICS TEAM " TNT ), WHICH WAS USED TO CLEAN UP A PARTICULARLY DRUG INFESTED AREA OF QUEENS THE PROCESS OF EXPANDING ITS EFFORTS CITYWIDE WITH CLOSE TO ADDITIONAL THIS HUGE EXPANSION OUR DRUG ENFORCEMENT EFFORTS WILL OBVIOUSLY PUT PRESSURE ON OUR CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM IT WILL NECESSITATE AN INCREASE IN JAIL BEDS OVER AND ABOVE THE IN MY CURRENT CAPITAL PLAN AND THE ADDED IN THE LAST TWO ZT INCREASE THE CASELOADS OP DISTRICT ATTORNEYS THE LEGAL AZD SOCIETY WHO WILL RECEIVE MILLION THAN PREVIOUSLY PLANNED THE NEXT TWO YEARS THE TOTAL PRICE TAG FOR THIS EXPANSION MILLION HOW FUND IT BY MAKING SOME TOUGH DECISIONS RAISE TAXES ON CIGARETTES AND ALCOHOL TEMPORARILY INCREASE LOCAL PROPERTY TAXES OR IF NEITHER THESE ALTERNATIVES ARE SUCCESSFUL CUT SOME CITY SERVICES HOWEVER WE IT IT MUST BE DONE REACTION OF SOME PEOPLE TO MY PROPOSAL HAS BEEN THAT PERHAPS SHOULD WAIT AND HOPE THE NEXT PRESIDENT AND THE NEW CONGRESS BE ABLE TO DO MORE TO FIGHT DRUGS BUT THOSE OF US OUT THERE ON THE FRONT LINES THOSE WHO DEAL ON A DAILY BASIS WITH THE RAVAGES OF THIS WAR SIMPLY CAN T AFFORD TO WAIT MR CHAIRMAN IT COKES DOWN TO IS THIS WHEN WE SHOULD LEGALIZE DRUGS BECAUSE LAW ENFORCEMENT EFFORTS HAVE FAILED THEY IGNORE THE FACT A TRULY EFFECTIVE WAR HAS YET TO BE LAUNCHED AGAINST DRUGS WE REALLY NEED TO DO IS MORE NOT LESS REAL WAR OH DRUGS MUST INCLUDE INTERDICTION OF ILLICIT DRUGS BY THE ARMED FORCES AT THE BORDERS IN THE AIR AND ON THE HIGH SEAS IT MUST INCLUDE MORE FEDERAL FUNDING FOR EDUCATION AND TREATMENT ON DEMAND IT MUST INCLUDE MFEDERALIZATION " OF DRUG PROSECUTION AND INCARCERATION THESE ARE ALL IDEAS VE LAID OUT IN DETAIL IN PREVIOUS FORUMS CONTINUE TO STRIVE TO SEE THEY BECOME PART THE
