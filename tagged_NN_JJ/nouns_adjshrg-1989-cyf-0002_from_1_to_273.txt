anything something small Thank opportunity speak Chairman Miller Thank panel help testimony [ statement Dr Haynes Rice Prepared Statement op Dr Haynes Rice Hospital Director Howard University Hospital Washington DC INTRODUCTION GOOD MORNING LADIES AND GENTLEMEN MY NAME IS HAYNES RICE SERVED THE PAST YEARS THE DIRECTOR OF HOWARD UNIVERSITY HOSPITAL THE BED TEACHING HOSPITAL THE HOWARD UNIVERSITY CENTER FOR THE HEALTH SCIENCES COMING TO HOWARD WAS DEPUTY COMMISSIONER OF HEALTH WITH THE NEW YORK CITY HEALTH DEPARTMENT COME YOU TODAY TO SHARE MY INSTITUTION S PERSPECTIVE ON A PROBLEM WHICH STRIKES AT THE VERY CORE OUR NATION S PRESENT CONCERN WITH THE EFFECTS OF DRUGS AND DRUG ABUSE ON THE FABRIC THIS SOCIETY MY HOSPITAL AND HOSPITALS IN CITIES THE COUNTRY ARE FACING DAILY IS CARING FOR THOSE NEWBORN BABIES ABANDONED BY DRUG ABUSING MOTHERS WE CALL THESE TINY OFTEN UNSEEN VICTIMS THE URBAN DRUG EPIDEMIC BOARDER BABIES BOARDER BABIES ARE DEFINED ANY CHILD IN OUR HOSPITAL WHO NO LONGER ACUTELY ILL AND WHO HAS NOT HAD PARENTAL CONTACT WITHIN THE LAST THIRTY DAYS IT MAY BE INCREDULOUS TO SOME YOU HERE TO THINK A MOTHER WOULD JUST WALK AWAY THE CHILD SHE HAS SO RECENTLY DELIVERED IT REAL INCREASING PHENOMENON AMONG URBAN DRUG ABUSING FEMALES THE IMMEDIATE IMPACT THIS IS SEVERE OVERCROWDING THE NEONATAL INTENSIVE CARE UNIT AND PEDIATRIC UNITS THE LONGER TERM PROBLEM IS AN INABILITY TO DISCHARGE THE CHILD TO AN APPROPRIATE SETTING CAUSING THE HOSPITAL TO ACT A CARETAKER FOR WEEKS AND EVEN MONTHS AT A TIME HISTORY THE PROBLEM BOARDER BABIES ARE NOT AN ENTIRELY NEW PHENOMENON FOR HOSPITALS WHEN IN NEW YORK CITY THE PUBLIC HOSPITALS THERE HAD ABOUT BABIES WHO BEEN ABANDONED AT THE HOSPITALS BY HEROIN ADDICTED MOTHERS SOME THESE CHILDREN LITERALLY ENDED UP GOING TO SCHOOL FROM THE HOSPITAL DUE TO THE SLOWNESS OF GOVERNMENTAL RESPONSE TO PROVIDE TIMELY FOSTER CARE HOMES OR ADOPTION ALTERNATIVES BUT THERE WAS A KIND OF SUPPORT SYSTEM THESE EARLY CHILDREN IN THE EXTENDED FAMILY THE PARENTS OFTEN GRANDPARENTS WOULD TAKE THE RESPONSIBILITY FOR RAISING THE CHILD AND PROVIDE A MORE STABLE ENVIRONMENT OR THERE WOULD BE ADEQUATE ACCESS TO PUBLICLY OPERATED FACILITIES TO CARE THE CHILDREN THESE HISTORICAL ALTERNATIVES HELPED KEEP THE PROBLEM MANAGEABLE IN PAST YEARS SO THAT NOT TOO MANY CHILDREN ENDED UP LIVING IN HOSPITALS THIS NOW HOSPITALS ARE CAUGHT IN THE MIDDLE NATURE OP THE CURRENT PROBLEM IN THE FIVE MONTH PERIOD OP AUGUST TO DECEMBER THE PEDIATRIC NEONATOLOGIST AT HOWARD CONDUCTED A STUDY THE LONG STAY INFANTS AND FOUND SOME STARTLING FIGURES THE OCCUPANCY RATE THE FIVE MONTHS WAS YEAR TO DATE OCCUPANCY WAS % THESE FIGURES CAME ABOUT BECAUSE WHEREAS THE NORMAL EXPECTED STAY A NEWBORN IS THREE DAYS THE ACTUAL AVERAGE LENGTH OF STAY WAS A LITTLE OVER TWELVE DAYS THIS LONGER LENGTH OF STAY IS REQUIRED FOR OBSERVATION OF DRUG WITHDRAWAL SYMPTOMS OF BABIES BORN TO DRUG ABUSING MOTHERS WHERE THIS CURRENT PROBLEM DIFFERS FROM THE HISTORICAL PROBLEM THE REACH THE DRUG ABUSE ACROSS MULTIPLE GENERATIONS NOW WE ARE SEEING TO YEAR OLD GRANDMOTHERS WHO ARE THEMSELVES SUBSTANCE ABUSERS AND WHO CAN NOT READILY STEP IN TO PROVIDE THE SOCIAL SUPPORT AS IN THE PAST IN THE MOTHERS THEMSELVES THERE IS INCREASING USE AND ABUSE OF DRUGS DURING THEIR PREGNANCY AND RIGHT UP TO THE DELIVERY DATE IN SOME CASES ON MONTHLY BASIS % DELIVERING MOTHJERS VOLUNTARILY ADMIT TO DRUG USE THIS ACTUAL USAGE IS PROBABLY CLOSER TO % THE DELIVERING MOTHERS OF COURSE THE BABIES BORN TO DRUG ABUSING MOTHERS ARE OFTEN PREMATURE LOW BIRTH WEIGHT AND SUFFER FROM DRUG WITHDRAWAL SYMPTOMS AT BIRTH AN INDICATION THE LOW HEALTH STATUS THE FRAGILE NEWBORNS AT ONE TIME ONLY BABIES OUT A TOTAL WERE HEALTHY ENOUGH TO BE FED BY THEIR MOTHERS AFTER BIRTH THERE TYPE RECIDIVISM WE SEE AMONG DRUG ABUSING MOTHERS IN THAT WOMEN DELIVERED ONE CHILD WILL AGAIN BECOME PREGNANT AND DELIVER ANOTHER CHILD WITH THE SAME OUTCOME PREMATURE LOW BIRTH WEIGHT AND HAVING DRUG WITHDRAWAL SYMPTOMS MOST TRAGIC CASES WE HAVE IS A YEAR OLD DRUG ABUSER WHO HAS DELIVERED AND ABANDONED A BABY IN OUR HOSPITAL WE SHE IS PREGNANT AGAIN MOTHER IS HIV POSITIVE IMPACT THE CURRENT PROBLEM IN THE FIVE MONTH STUDY WHICH PREVIOUSLY MENTIONED THERE WERE BABIES WHO WERE LONG STAY BABIES WITH AN AVERAGE LENGTH OF STAY DAYS NINETEEN THE BABIES HAD DRUG ABUSING MOTHERS THE LONGEST STAY INFANT HAD BEEN IN THE HOSPITAL FOR DAYS AT A COST IN EXCESS OF HOSPITAL RECEIVES PER MEDICAID DISCHARGE FOR A PATIENT LIKE THIS REGARDLESS THE LENGTH OF STAY OR SERVICES PERFORMED THE OVERCROWDING PROBLEM IS NOT JUST CONFINED TO ONE OR TWO HOSPITALS LOCALLY WORST WE SEEN IT GET WAS WHEN WE WERE UNABLE TO IDENTIFY AN EMPTY NICU BED BETWEEN PHILADELPHIA AND RICHMOND THE WORST THE OVERCROWDING PROBLEM HAS GOTTEN INTERNALLY WAS WHEN WE HIGH BABIES IN A UNIT DESIGNED A MAXIMUM OF BABIES WITH THESE TYPES OF CONDITIONS THE IMPACT THE PROBLEM GOES FAR BEYOND THE POOR WOMEN AND CHILDREN WHICH WE HAVE DISCUSSED THE EXPECTED INCREASE IN MATERNAL MORTALITY DUE TO THE POOR HEALTH STATUS THESE DELIVERING MOTHERS WE ARE SEEING ACCESS TO SERVICES BY NON POOR WOMEN MIDDLE CLASS WOMEN BEING THREATENED BECAUSE THE LARGER NUMBERS OF POOR WOMEN REQUIRING MORE HEALTH CARE RESOURCES WE ARE ALSO SEEING AN IMPACT ON MALPRACTICE COSTS THE RESULTANT DAMPENING EFFECT ON THE PRACTICE OF CERTAIN MEDICAL SPECIALTIES LIKE OB / GYN A TELEPHONE SURVEY THE LOCAL DC HOSPITALS CONDUCTED LAST WEEK INDICATED THERE WERE THEN ABANDONED BABIES IN WASHINGTON DC WITH AT HOWARD UNIVERSITY HOSPITAL AND THE REST DISTRIBUTED AMONG CHILDREN S HOSPITAL NATIONAL MEDICAL CENTER DC GENERAL HOSPITAL GEORGE WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CENTER AND GEORGETOWN UNIVERSITY HOSPITAL CAN READILY SEE BY THESE FIGURES THAT THIS PROBLEM NOT CONFINED ONLY TO ONE TYPE OF HOSPITAL E ., PUBLIC GENERAL HOSPITALS IN THE HEALTH CARE SYSTEM RECOMMENDATIONS TO ADDRESS THE PROBLEM PAST EFFORTS ON THE STATE LEVEL TO ADDRESS THESE PROBLEMS HAVE NOT MET WITH GOOD SUCCESS WHILE INDIVIDUAL EFFORTS SUCH HALE HOUSE IN NEW YORK AND GRANDMA S HOUSE HERE IN WASHINGTON ARE TO BE COMMENDED THEY ARE LIMITED APPROACHES THAT CAN NOT FULLY ADDRESS THE GROWING PROBLEM HOSPITALS ARE NOW FACING UNLESS THERE A COORDINATED EFFORT THAT IS FACILITATED BY THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT DAILY WE ALL SEE IN THE PAPERS THE VIOLENT SIDE THE DRUG EPIDEMIC IN OUR STREETS BUT FEW OF US SEE THE TINY VICTIMS THIS DRUG EPIDEMIC WHO DID NOT CHOSE TO BE A PART THE DRUG CULTURE BUT ARE HELD PRISONER BY IT WE NEED TO DEVELOP ADDITIONAL MODE ^ PROGRAMS THAT ARE RESPONSIVE TO THE NEEDS OF THESE SMALL BABIES AND THAT CAN PROVIDE THEM WITH THE APPROPRIATE CARE AND LOVE IN A PROPER SETTING NATURE OF SOLUTIONS IS LONGER TERM MOST HAVE NOT MOVED AGGRESSIVELY TO ADDRESS THE PROBLEM BUT THE NEEDS GROW LARGER EACH DAY THERE IS DELAY A PUBLIC / PRIVATE PARTNERSHIP IS NEEDED TO EFFECTIVELY MEET THIS PROBLEM THIS PARTNERSHIP WILL OF NECESSITY INVOLVE BOTH THE FEDERAL AND STATE GOVERNMENTS THE PRIVATE SECTOR LIKE TO SUGGEST THE FOLLOWING ACTIVITIES THAT CAN BEGIN TO ADDRESS THE CURRENT BOARDER BABY PROBLEM • STREAMLINE THE FOSTER CARE AND ADOPTION PROVISIONS THAT ARE REQUIRED IN ORDER TO EXPEDITE THE PLACEMENT THESE CHILDREN — CURRENTLY IN THE WASHINGTON AREA IT TAKES TOO LONG OFTEN SIX MONTHS OR MORE TO MOVE THROUGH THE FOSTER CARE OR ADOPTION PROCESS AND DURING THIS TIME THE CHILD REMAINS IN AN ACUTE CARE SETTING EVEN THOUGH THERE NO NEED FOR ACUTE HEALTH CARE • * PROVIDE FOR INTERMEDIATE TEMPORARY HOMES THAT ARE NOT CONNECTED WITH THE CORRBCTIONS / JAIL SYSTEM — THESE SMALL CHILDREN NEED TO BE IN A LESS EXPENSIVE NON ACUTE SETTING WHERE THEY CAN BE NURTURED AND WHERE SOME TYPE BONDING WITH PEOPLE CAN TAKE PLACE FOR HEALTHY PSYCHO SOCIAL DEVELOPMENT • INCREASE THE VISIBILITY ON THIS ASPECT THE WAR ON DRUGS SO WE CAN MAKE A POSITIVE MARK ON THESE LIVES WE SEEN THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT MOVED TO ACT AGAINST THE ENEMY THOSE WHO WOULD BRING ILLEGAL DRUGS INTO OUR COMMUNITIES AND PROFIT FROM ITS DISTRIBUTION WE ALSO MUST HAVE EFFORTS TO ASSIST THE CASUALTIES OF THIS WAR ON DRUGS AND CERTAINLY THESE LITTLE BABIES ARE THE GREATEST CASUALTIES IN THIS DRUG WAR CONCLUSION THIS ADMINISTRATION AND CONGRESS MAKE FURTHER TO COMBAT THE DRUG EPIDEMIC IN OUR CITIES AND ADMINISTER JUSTICE TO THOSE WHO SEEK TO VICTIMIZE OTHERS IN DAILY DRUG WARS LET US NOT FORGET TO ALSO SHOW COMPASSION ON THESE SMALL BABIES WHO THE VICTIMS THAT FALL BETWEEN THE CRACKS GOVERNMENT SOME OF YOU MIGHT SAY WE CAN T AFFORD TO DO ANY MORE BUT A SOCIETY WE CAN NOT AFFORD THE CONSEQUENCES OF DOING ANY LESS THAN THESE RECOMMENDATIONS THANK YOU YOU ATTENTION Chairman Miller Ms Galien something Mr Rice aspect problem survey something re find
