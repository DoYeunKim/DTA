OUR STUDY ON CRACK BABIES YOU KNOW CRACK IS COCAINE IN A SMOKEABLE FORM ACCORDING THE NATIONAL INSTITUTE ON DRUG ABUSE NIDA ), OVER MILLION WOMEN OF CHILD BEARING AGE ARE USING ILLEGAL SUBSTANCES MILLION THESE WOMEN ARE USING COCAINE THE PRESIDENT S NATIONAL DRUG CONTROL STRATEGY REPORT HAS ESTIMATED THAT YEAR BABIES ARE BORN EXPOSED TO CRACK PRENATAL EXPOSURE TO COCAINE CAN LEAD TO PREMATURE BIRTH LOW BIRTHWEIGHT BIRTH DEFECTS AND RESPIRATORY AND NEUROLOGICAL PROBLEMS CRACK BABIES HAVE A SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER RATE OF SUDDEN INFANT DEATH SYNDROME SIDS THAN BABIES NOT EXPOSED * PRENATALLY EXPERTS BELIEVE THAT MANY CRACK BABIES WILL SUFFER DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITIES THE FULL RANGE OF LONG TERM EFFECTS OF PRENATAL COCAINE EXPOSURE ARE NOT NOW KNOWN WHEN CRACK BABIES ARB IDENTIFIED LOCAL

TOTAL NUMBER OF CHILDREN WHO NEED FOSTER PLACEMENT IS INCREASING IN NEEDED PLACEMENT BY NUMBER ROSE TO TO DEAL WITH THE DEMAND SOME AGENCIES PUT MORE CHILDREN IN EACH FOSTER HOME SHIFT CHILDREN BETWEEN HOMES SEPARATE SIBLINGS AND PLACE CHILDREN IN GROUP HOMES BLACK FOSTER PARENTS AND HOMES THAT ACCEPT INFANTS ARE IN SHORT SUPPLY RESPONDENTS IN FOUR CITIES REPORT A PARTICULAR SHORTAGE OF HOMES FOR INFANTS WITH SPECIAL NEEDS IN STATE THAT PROHIBITS INTERRACIAL PLACEMENT THE BABIES ARE PREDOMINANTLY BLACK BUT WE WERE TOLD THERE SHORTAGE OF BLACK FOSTER PARENTS LOW REIMBURSEMENT IS ONE REASON THE FOSTER PARENT SHORTAGE RESPONDENTS SAY REIMBURSEMENTS ARE TOO LOW TO ATTRACT FULL TIME FOSTER PARENTS ESPECIALLY FOR BABIES WITH SPECIAL MEDICAL NEEDS REIMBURSEMENT RATE SCHEDULES ARE COMPLEX AND LACK UNIFORMITY CITY VISITED HAS DIFFERENT PAYMENT CATEGORIES RANGING FROM TO YEAR RESPONDENTS ALSO SUGGEST FOSTER PARENTS NEED TRAINING AND SUPPORT SERVICES SUCH AS DAY CARE

STORIES RADIO AND TV TALK SHOWS AND PAID ADVERTISING BUT THESE EFFORTS OFTEN RESULT IN AN OUTPOURING OF COMMUNITY RESPONSE THE NUMBER WHO ACTUALLY GO ON TO BECOME FOSTER PARENTS IS LOWER BECAUSE SOME APPLICANTS ARE DISQUALIFIED AND OTHERS LOSE INTEREST RESTRICTIONS ON INTERRACIAL PLACEMENTS AND REQUIRING FOSTER PARENTS TO LIVE WITHIN CERTAIN GEOGRAPHIC LIMITS HAVE ALSO REDUCED THE POOL OF FOSTER
