MAY TODAY ’ S HEARING >• ONE OF A SERIES OF HEARINGS CONCERNING THE NATIONAL DRUG CONTROL STRATEGY EXAMINES AN OMINOUS NEW TREND IN OUR DRUG EPIDEMIC WE OFTEN TALK OUR FAILURE TO KEEP DRUGS OUT THIS COUNTRY OUR FAILURE TO PREVENT THEIR DISTRIBUTION OUR FAILURE TO PROVIDE ADEQUATE TREATMENT PROGRAMS STOPPING TO THINK THE HUMAN CONSEQUENCES THESE FAILURES TODAY S HEARING PROVIDES US ONE CASE STUDY OF THOSE CONSEQUENCES SCHOOL ADMINISTRATORS AND LOCAL OFFICIALS FROM THE COUNTRY HAVE WIDELY REPORTED THAT THEIR SCHOOLS ARE BEING FLOODED BY A HUGE INCREASE IN CHILDREN NEEDING SPECIAL EDUCATION SCHOOL OFFICIALS AND OTHER EXPERTS OUR WITNESSES HERE TODAY THESE INCREASE FOLLOW JUST A FEW YEARS AFTER THE CRACK COCAINE EPIDEMIC FIRST HIT AMERICAN CITIES TODAY WITH THE HELP OF OUR WITNESSES LEADING EXPERTS THE FIELD ~ WE WILL TAKE THIS FIRST LOOK AT THIS SHOCKING CONSEQUENCE OUR DRUG EPIDEMIC TREMENDOUS RISE IN SPECIAL EDUCATION NEEDS IN CITIES ACROSS THE NATION MAJOR CAUSE ~ BUT LET ME BE CLEAR NOT THE ONLY CAUSE THIS RISE CAN BE WHEN WE LOOK BACK TO WHEN THESE CHILDREN WERE BORN TO FIRST YEARS THE CURRENT CRACK EPIDEMIC "' i A FEW CHARTS TO ILLUSTRATE HOW SERIOUS PROBLEM THIS OUR FIRST TWO CHARTS SHOW THE FOLLOWING IN TWO THE CITIES FIRST HIT BY THE CRACK COCAINE EPIDEMIC MIAMI AND LOS ANGELES NUMBER OF TO YEAR OLDS IN SPECIAL EDUCATION HAS DOUBLED SINCE WHEN THIS EPIDEMIC BEGAN * IN NEW YORK CITY THE LAST YEAR ALONE SAW A % INCREASE IN THE NUMBER OF TO YEAR OLDS IN SPECIAL EDUCATION PROGRAMS * * CITIES OF EVERY SIZE AND IN EVERY REGION THE COUNTRY ARE SUFFERING THESE HUGE INCREASES COLUMBUS NASHVILLE EL PASO AND SEATTLE ALL SAW AN EXPLOSION IN THE NUMBER OF YOUNG CHILDREN NEEDING SPECIAL EDUCATION IN THE YEARS SINCE THE SPREAD OF CRACK COCAINE COST THESE CHILDRENS * SUFFERING OF COURSE CANNOT BE MEASURED IN MERE DOLLARS HOWEVER AS CAN SEE FROM OUR THIRD CHART THE ANNUAL COST THE SPECIAL EDUCATION SERVICES REQUIRED BY JUST ONE CHILD RUNS AS HIGH TO FOUR TIMES THE COST OF EDUCATION IN A REGULAR CLASSROOM \ THIS MEANS THAT IN JUST THE CITIES SURVEYED ANNUAL SPECIAL EDUCATION COST INCREASED BY THAN SINCE THE CRACK COCAINE EPIDEMIC FIRST HIT THESE CITIES BUT AS BAD THE SITUATION IS ALREADY THESE TRENDS ARE ALMOST SURE TO WORSEN IN THE YEARS AHEAD YEAR OLDS IN SPECIAL EDUCATION PROGRAMS TODAY WILL BE ENTERING KINDERGARTEN IN THE FALL AND MORE YOUNG CHILDREN ARE ON THE WAY ~ INDEED THE WAVE OF CHILDREN ENTERING SPECIAL EDUCATION PROGRAMS CAN BE EXPECTED TO FOLLOW THE SAME GRIM MARCH ACROSS AMERICA THE CRACK COCAINE EPIDEMIC BEGAN IN IN SHORT THE TEARS WE SHED A FEW YEARS AGO AT THE SIGHT THE FIRST " CRACK BABIES " WRITHING IN HOSPITAL INCUBATORS BE MULTIPLIED MANY TIMES MORE WITH SHOUTS OF FRUSTRATION AND DESPAIR WE WATCH THESE CHILDREN ENTER OUR NATION ’ S CLASSROOMS OUR WITNESSES HERE TODAY THE NATION ’ S LEADING PEDIATRIC RESEARCHERS AND EDUCATORS IN THIS FIELD WILL TELL US THE TWO MAJOR LINKS BETWEEN CRACK \ COCAINE THE RECENT MASSIVE RISE IN THE NEED FOR SPECIAL EDUCATION FIRST FETAL EXPOSURE TO COCAINE CAUSES A GREAT RANGE OF NEUROLOGICAL PROBLEMS AND SECOND MANY TEACHERS ALSO NOTE THAT CHILDREN RAISED IN DRUG ABUSING HOMES OFTEN SUFFER DEEP PSYCHOLOGICAL WOUNDS A RESULT THESE TWIN EFFECTS " NATURE AND NURTURE ," IF YOU WILL COMBINE TO LEAVE CRACK EXPOSED TODDLERS ILL EQUIPPED UNABLE TO LEARN TO LISTEN TO PLAY LIKE OTHER KIDS TOO FEW THESE TODDLERS BEEN HELPED ARE ONLY A HANDFUL OF INNOVATIVE PROGRAMS DESIGNED TO PREPARE THEM FOR KINDERGARTEN AND THE YEARS AHEAD THE REST THESE CHILDREN WILL START SCHOOL ALREADY SEVERAL STEPS BEHIND THEIR PEERS UNLESS THEY GET HELP THEY WILL FALL FURTHER BEHIND STILL OBVIOUSLY URGENT ACTION IS NEEDED THAT WHY SUPPORT TWO MAJOR PIECES OF LEGISLATION OFFERED BY SENATOR KENNEDY AND SENATOR DODD TWO THE NATION ’ S LEADING ADVOCATES FOR CHILDREN AND EDUCATION SENATOR KENNEDY ’ S " SCHOOL READINESS ACT ," EXPANDING PRENATAL CARE PROGRAMS THE HEADSTART PROGRAM TO ALL CHILDREN WILL GO A LONG WAY TO ENSURING THE HEALTHY DEVELOPMENT ALL INFANTS AND YOUNG CHILDREN THE " CHILDREN OF SUBSTANCE ABUSERS ACT ," AUTHORED BY SENATOR DODD IS ALSO A VITAL COMPONENT TO RESPOND TO THE MASSIVE INCREASE IN SPECIAL EDUCATION NEEDS WITH ITS PROPOSAL TO HELP TREAT DRUG ADDICTED PARENTS AND FAMIUES ABOVE ALL WE MUST FUNDAMENTALLY REDIRECT OUR NATIONAL DRUG CONTROL STRATEGY THE THAT SENATORS KENNEDY AND DODD HAVE PROPOSED CAN HELP US COPE WITH THE PROBLEMS OF CRACK BABIES WHO ARE NOW GROWING UP A REDIRECTED DRUG STRATEGY CAN HELP PREVENT SUCH TRAGEDIES IN THE FUTURE ADMINISTRATION ’ S DRUG STRATEGY PROVIDES TREATMENT FOR ONLY OF PREGNANT ADDICTS THE ALTERNATIVE STRATEGY PROPOSED WOULD PROVIDE TREATMENT FOR ALL PREGNANT ADDICTS WITHIN THE NEXT TWO YEARS YES MY PROGRAM HAS ITS COSTS MILLION YEAR BUT WE WILL HEAR TODAY A CONTINUATION THE ADMINISTRATION ’ S PROGRAM HAS MORE STAGGERING COSTS BOTH IN TERMS OF DOLLARS AND HUMAN LIVES IN CLOSING THIS FIRST LOOK AT THE MASSIVE RISE OF SPECIAL EDUCATION NEEDS WILL CONFIRM OUR WORST FEARS COST OF TOO MANY YEARS OF INACTION IS HITTING HOME TODAY WE CANNOT DELAY ANY LONGER WE MUST ADDRESS THE CRISIS THE DRUG BABIES WHO HAVE ALREADY

MAINTAINS THE WORTHY GOAL OF PRESERVING THE FAMILY UNIT HOWEVER IT DOES ACKNOWLEDGE THAT OUR PRESENT SUPPORT SYSTEMS MAY KEEP SOME FAMILIES TOGETHER TO THE DETRIMENT THE CHILDREN OF THOSE DRUG ADDICTS WHO ARE WHATEVER REASON UNABLE TO STOP THEIR DRUG USE THE STRATEGY CALLS THE TO CONSIDER POLICIES THAT TERMINATE APPROPRIATE PARENTAL RIGHTS THAT REMOVE THE CHILD OR CHILDREN FROM PARENTAL CUSTODY AS EXPEDITIOUSLY POSSIBLE THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES IS TO ENCOURAGE THE TO ESTABLISH FACILITIES TO PROTECT CHILDREN AT RISK OF CHILD ABUSE NEGLECT OR INCEST THEIR DRUG ADDICTED PARENTS

COMPREHENSIVE SYSTEM THE DELIVERY OF SERVICES FOR DRUG EXPOSED NEWBORNS SUCH PRE NATAL CARE CHILD WELFARE SPECIAL EDUCATION AND OTHER DRUG PREVENTION SERVICES THIS A CALL FOR COORDINATION AT ALL LEVELS OF GOVERNMENT THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES IS ATTEMPTING TO IMPROVE THE COORDINATION THESE SERVICES AT THE FEDERAL AND STATE LEVEL HISTORICALLY DRUG EDUCATION AND PREVENTION HAVE BEEN " SHARED " RESPONSIBILITIES EDUCATION HAS OF COURSE BEEN THE RESPONSIBILITY OF LOCAL AND STAVE GOVERNMENTS THE PRIVATE SECTOR HAS BEEN ACTIVE IN UNDERWRITING IMPORTANT AND EFFECTIVE PREVENTION PROGRAMS BUT AS HIGHLIGHTED IN THE NATIONAL DRUG CONTROL STRATEGY THERE A STRONG ROLE THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT IN PROMOTING DRUG EDUCATION AND DRUG PREVENTION THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT HAS THE ABILITY TO
