NATIONAL SECURITY ANO ON GOVERNMENT INFORMATION JUSTICE AND AGRICULTURE CITY OOUNTY BUILDING DETROIT MICHIGAN DECEMBER DAVID FUKUZAWA THE DIRECTOR OF HEALTH AND SUBSTANCE ABUSE AT NEW OETROIT INC SOME YOU KNOW NEW DETROIT NATION S OLDEST URBAN COALITION FORMED ORIGINALLY AFTER THE RIOTS WHICH DEVASTATED THIS CITY THAN TWO DECADES AGO OUR MISSION ROOTED IN THE VISION WHICH GAVE BIRTH TO NEW DETROIT TO ADVOCATE ON BEHALF THE CITY S AFRICAN AMERICAN AND MINORITY POPULATIONS AND TO " SPECIFICALLY INVOLVE THE ENTIRE METROPOLITAN COftIUNITY IN THE ELIMINATION OF SOCIAL AND EOONOMIC INJUSTICE THE RESOLUTION OF BASIC SOCIAL PROBLEMS ." TODAY TO GIVE TO YOU OUR PERSPECTIVE ON THE DRUG ABUSE PROBLEM IN DETROIT THE IMPACT — OR POTENTIAL IMPACT — WHICH THE NATIONAL DRUG CONTROL STRATEGY MIGHT HAVE UPON IT ALTHOUGH THE PROBLEM OF SUBSTANCE ABUSE HAS RECENTLY BEEN PROMOTED TO AN ISSUE OF NATIONAL IMPORTANCE THE PRESIDENT S PLAN NEW DETROIT HAS LONG BEEN INVOLVED IN DEVELOPING ANTI SUBSTANCE ABUSE STRATEGIES AND POLICY FOR MANY YEARS NOW THE ISSUE OF DRUGS AND DRUG RELATED CRIME HAS BEEN THE FOCUS OF COMMUNITY CONCERN MUCH SO LAST YEAR THE NEW DETROIT BOARD OF TRUSTEES EMPOWERED AN AD HOC COMMITTEE ON SUBSTANCE ABUSE AND CRIME TO STUDY DRUG CONTROL POLICY IN THE METRO DETROIT AREA LET ME NOTE ALSO THAT NEW DETROIT HAS BEEN STUDYING THE ISSUE OF | g §& v ■« r PRESCRIPTION DRUG ABUSE FOR YEARS FEDERAL REGULATORY AGENCIES HAVE DOCUMENTED MICHIGAN LEADING THE NATION IN THIS ASPECT OF DRUG ABUSE WE ADVOCATED FOR STRONG LEGISLATION PROVIDING A SYSTEM OF PRESCRIBING DISPENSING AND PURCHASING SCHEDULE ORUGS AND JUST LAST AUGUST IMPLEMENTATION OF PUBLIC ACT WHICH PROVIDES SUCH A SYSTEM WE HAVE ALSO SUPPORTED EFFORTS TO EXPAND MICHIGAN ’ S DRUG FORFEITURE LAW TO INCLUDE ANY AND ALL REAL PROPERTY USED IN CONNECTION WITH ILLEGAL DRUG POSSESSION AND SALES WE FAVORED USING A PORT THESE FUND FOR COMMUNITY BASED PREVENTION AND EDUCATION EFFORTS IN ADDITION TO LAW ENFORCEMENT USES PREVENTION FRONT NEW DETROIT HAS OPERATED THE PAST FOUR SUCCESSFUL MINI GRANT PROGRAM DESIGNED TO ENCOURAGE GRASS ROOTS ORGANIZATIONS TO BECOME INVOLVED IN SUBSTANCE ABUSE PREVENTION SINCE WE HAVE AWARDED OVER SUCH GRANTS TOTALLING YEAR WE PLAN TO PROVIDE MINI GRANTS TOTALLING TO COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS AND FOR THE FIRST TIME WE ARE ALSO FUNDING THE FORMATION OF NEIGHBORHOOD COALITIONS TO HELP IN THE CREATION OF DRUG FREE ZONES NEW DETROIT HAS ALSO BEEN INTEGRALLY INVOLVED IN THE DEVELOPMENT THE FACT PROGRAM FAMILY APPROACH TO CRIME AND TREATMENT THE FACT PROGRAM THE INITIATIVES THE DETROIT STRATEGIC PLAN — REPRESENTS AN INNOVATIVE AND COST EFFECTIVE METHOD TO DEAL WITH EX OFFENDERS AND DRUG ABUSERS IT IS INNOVATIVE SINCE IT TREATS THE INDIVIDUAL IN THE CONTEXT %‘ i ’ V THE FAMILY AND COST EFFECTIVE SINCE RESEARCH INDICATES THAT FAMILY BASEO APPROACHES COST ON AVERAGE TWO THIRDS LESS THAN CONVENTIONAL INDIVIDUAL APPROACHES CURRENTLY NEW DETROIT IS INVOLVED IN A " THINK TANK ON SUBSTANCE ABUSE PREVENTION FACILITATED BY THE UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN SCHOOL OF PUBLIC POLICY THE THINK TANK A CONSORTIUM OF CORPORATE AND PROFESSIONAL LEADERSHIP CONCERNED THE DRUG ABUSE PROBLEM AND WHICH HAS BEEN MEETING WITH LEADING EXPERTS IN DRUG ABUSE PREVENTION THE PAST YEAR THE CONCLUSIONS REACHED BY THE THINK TANK BE ANNOUNCED SOMETIME IN THE SPRING OF RECENTLY NEW DETROIT WAS INVITED BY THE SKiLUIAN FOUNDATION TO JOIN A GROUP OF SPONSORING ORGANIZATIONS A RAND CORPORATION STUDY THE SUBSTANCE ABUSE PROBLEM IN THE METRO DETROIT AREA THIS STUDY WILL FOLLOW CLOSELY THE OUTLINE AND METHODS A STUDY COMPLETED THIS YEAR IN THE GREATER WASHINGTON D C AREA THE GOAL THE DETROIT STUDY IT WAS THE WASHINGTON D C STUDY IS TO PROVIDE A SOURCE DOCUMENT FOR FURTHER Pa ICY DEVELOPMENT AND DRUG OONTRa STRATEGY YOU CAN SEE THESE EXAMPLES OUR INVaVEMENT NEW DETROIT HAS LONG ADVOCATED A MULTIDIMENSIONAL ATTACK ON THE SUBSTANCE ABUSE PROBLEM FOR MANY WE BROUGHT TOGETHER PREVENTION TREATMENT AD LAW ENFORCEMENT PROFESSIONALS AND LEADERS TOGETHER IN OUR SUBSTANCE ABUSE COMMITTEE IN ORDER TO SHARE INFORMATION AND TO COORDINATE EFFORTS RECENTLY WE HAVE ALSO ADDED KEY REPRESENTATIVES FROM THE HEALTH AND % w « ,* *••'• v •£' MEDICAL FIELDS THE NATIONAL DRUG CONTROL STRATEGY REPRESENTS A FIRST STEP IN PROVIDING COORDINATED FEDERAL LEADERSHIP ON ALL THESE DIFFERENT FRONTS OF PREVENTION TREATMENT AND LAW ENFORCEMENT BUT LET ME ALSO SAY THAT AS FAR DETROIT GOES IT IS PERHAPS STILL TOO EARLY TO SEE ANY RESULTS THE NATIONAL PLAN AND CERTAINLY TOO EARLY TO SEE ANY NEW DOLLARS COMING INTO EDUCATION AND TREATMENT WE KNOW THAT BY MANY THE LATEST STATISTICS WE HAVE AVAILABLE THE PROBLEMS OF DRUG AND ALOQHOL ABUSE AND DRUG RELATED CRIME REMAIN STUBBORNLY HIGH FOR EXAMPLE WE HAVE SEEN AN OVER PERCENT INCREASE IN NARCOTICS CHARGE ARRAIGNMENTS IN OUR DISTRICT COURT THAT OVER PERCENT OF CRIME IN DETROIT IS DRUG RELATED INTENSIFIED LAW ENFORCEMENT CRACKDOWNS HAVE INCREASED THE NUMBER OF ARRESTS BUT THOSE ARRESTED REPRESENT AN INCREASED BURDEN TO AN ALREADY OVERBURDENED PRISON CAPACITY STUDY BY THE NEW DETROIT AD HOC OOMMITTEE ON SUBSTANCE ABUSE AND CRIME REVEALED THAT AS OF JUNE THE PRISON POPULATION IN MICHIGAN EXCEEDED CAPACITY BY NcW PRISON BUILDING WOULD HELP ALLEVIATE THIS DEFICIT BY THE END OF BUT EVEN THIS WOULD NOT KEEP PACE WITH THE EXPLODING PRISON POPULATION BY DECEMBER THE STATE HOPES TO ADO NEW BEDS TO ITS PRISONS BUT THE PROJECTED PRISONER INCREASE IN THE SAME PERIOD IT RESULTING IN A SPACE DEFICIT OF ALMOST DESPITE THE CRASH BUILDING PROGRAM m pr V ■*/ ife treatment capacity poor SEEKING DRUG TREATMENT OFTEN HAVE TO WAIT SOMETIMES UP TO DAYS THEY ARE ADMITTED INTO A TREATMENT PROGRAM THE EPIDEMIC OF CRACK OOCAJNE HAS FURTHER FRUSTRATED TREATMENT PROFESSIONALS NATIONWIDE WE UNDERSTAND EXPERTS ARE STILL SEARCHING FOR EFFECTIVE TREATMENT PROGRAMS THE CRACK ADOICT SINCE THE CRACK ADOICT TYPICALLY ONLY STAYS IN TREATMENT UNTIL HE OR SHE FEELS BETTER NOT UNTIL THE ADDICTION IS BROKEN AND REHABILITATION HAS TAKEN PLACE IN ITS LATEST REPORT ON DRUG ABUSE IN DETROIT AND WAYNE COUNTY THE STATE OFFICE OF SUBSTANCE ABUSE SERVICES FOUND THAT OOCAINE ANO CRACK ABUSE ACCOUNTED FOR PERCENT OF ADMISSIONS TO TREATMENT PROGRAMS IN THE STUDY AREA THIS RATE IS PROJECTED TO INCREASE TO PERCENT IN OOCAINE ABUSE ALSO RESPONSIBLE A HIGH PERCENTAGE OF EMERGENCY ROOM ADMISSIONS THIS STATISTIC IS CORROBORATED BY THE DRUG ABUSE WARNING NETWORK DAWN ), WHICH TRACKS MEDICAL EMERGENCIES AND DEATHS FROM TO DAWN FIGURES FOR DETROIT SHOW THE NUMBER OF EMERGENCY ROOM CASES WHERE OOCAINE WAS MENTIONED INCREASED PERCENT THESE THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE WHO REPORTED SMOKING OOCAINE JUMPED ALMOST PERCENT HEALTH RELATED PROBLEMS ARE STILL AT CRITICAL LEVELS THE INFANT MORTALITY RATE IN HIGHLAND PARK STANDS PERSISTENTLY AT ABOUtMO DEATHS PER THOUSAND BIRTHS A RATE WHICH EXCEEDS THOSE IN DEVELOPING COUNTRIES THE INFANT MORTALITY RATE FOR DETROIT IN GENERAL STILL IS UNACCEPTABLY HIGH ESPECIALLY FOR AFRICAN AMERICANS AND OTHER MINORITIES MUCH THIS ^ p rrr i ATTRIBUTABLE TO DRUG ABUSE WE MOST RECENTLY LEARNED FROM RESEARCH DONE AT HUTZEL HOSPITAL HERE IN DETROIT THAT ABOUT PERCENT THE BABIES BORN THERE HAVE TESTED POSITIVE FOR DRUGS TESTING HAIR SAMPLES OF NEWBORNS INDICATES THAT TWICE THAT AMOUNT ABOUT PERCENT AT LEAST EXPOSED TO DRUGS IN UTERO JUST THESE PROBLEMS OF EMERGENCY ROOM ADMISSIONS AND INFANT DEATH AND ADDICTION WOULD ADD MILLIONS TO MICHIGAN S ALREADY ASTRONOMIC MEDICAL BILL ADO TO THESE THE COSTS OF DRUG RELATED INJURIES AND DEATHS AND THE BILL FOR SOUTHEASTERN MICHIGAN ALONE IS ESTIMATED AT TO MILLION PER YEAR THESE OOSTS FURTHER RETARD EFFORTS BY NEW DETROIT AND OTHER HEALTH ADVOCATES TO INCREASE ACCESS TO HEALTH CARE BY THE POOR AND UNINSURED WE COMMEND THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT FOR SETTING CLEAR AND MEASURABLE GOALS ITS DRUG OONTROL STRATEGY ALL TOO OFTEN A NATION WE HAVE ESPOUSED LOFTY GOALS WITHOUT HAVING A CLEAR NOTION OF WHERE WE WANT TO BE BUT FOR DETROIT THE NUMBERS WHICH THE MOST MEANING ARE THOSE WHICH MENTIONED THE NUMBER OF INFANTS DYING THE NUMBERS OF PEOPLE STANDING IN LINE FOR TREATMENT OR FILLING EMERGENCY ROOMS THE COSTS OF DRUG RELATED CRIME AND INJURIES THESE ARE SOME THE NUMBERS WHICH SPELL OUT THE EFFECTS THE DRUG EPIDEMIC ON THE CITY OF DETROIT AND ITS RESIDENTS WE OF COURSE CANNOT MEASURE THE EMOTIONAL SPIRITUAL AND SOCIAL DAMAGE OF DRUG AND ALCOHOL ABUSE BUT A MERE REDUCTION IN THE RATE OF DRUG ABUSE AND USE REDUCTION WHICH WAS ALREADY HAPPENING EVEN THE NATIONAL DRUG OONTROL STRATEGY — WITHOUT A CONCURRENT REDUCTION IN ITS MOST DEVASTATING AND TRAGIC EFFECTS ON URBAN POPULATIONS WOULD BE A VICTORY ONLY FOR STATISTICIANS DESPITE THE TERRIBLE IMPACT THE DRUG PROBLEM ON THE CITY WE AT NEW DETROIT SEE A RESILIENT PEOPLE A MOBILIZED CITIZENRY AND INNOVATIVE AND ENTHUSIASTIC PARTICIPANTS IN THIS " WAR " ON DRUGS WE AGREE WITH THE PRESIDENT THAT NO DRUG OONTROL STRATEGY OOULD WORK WITHOUT THE INVOLVEMENT AND COOPERATION OF ORDINARY CITIZENS OUR CITY HAS WON NATIONAL RECOGNITION FOR CITIZEN INVOLVEMENT WHEN THE FORD FOUNDATION CONSIDERED THE SOUTHEASTERN MICHIGAN OOmJNITY FOUNDATION A HALF A MILLION DOLLAR GRANT IN SUBSTANCE ABUSE PREVENTION THE PROGRAMS THE FORD FOUNDATION WAS MOST IMPRESSED WITH WAS THE NEW DETROIT SUBSTANCE ABUSE PREVENTION MINI GRANT PROJECT PROGRAM RELIES ON GRASS ROOTS VOLUNTEER EFFORTS MY DESCRIPTION THE DRUG ABUSE PROBLEM IN DETROIT LEADS ME TO MAKE A NUMBER OF SUGGESTIONS IN THE MANAGEMENT AND IMPLEMENTATION THE NATIONAL DRUG OONTROL STRATEGY FIRST THE FEDERAL SUPPORT FOR COMMUNITY BASED PREVENTION STRATEGIES NEEDS TO BE INCREASED AND EXPANDED ALTHOUGH MANY THE OOftWNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS HERE IN DETROIT DO NOT REQUIRE LARGE BUDGETS FOR THEIR PREVENTION PROGRAMS ADDITIONAL SUPPORT WOULD ENABLE MANY MORE SUCH ORGANIZATIONS TO ENTER INTO THE FIGHT OUR MINI GRANT PROJECT RECEIVES MANY MORE APPLICATIONS THAN WE ARE ABLE TO FUND IN GENERAL ., WE BELIEVE THAT PREVENTION DESERVES MORE SUPPORT THERE GROWING COMMUNITY CONSENSUS EVEN AMONG MANY LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICIALS WE ARE DOING ALL WE CAN IN THE LAW ENFORCEMENT ARENA NEVERTHELESS THE SUPPLY OF COCAINE REMAINS AS HIGH EVER WITHOUT ANY DECREASE IN PURITY OR ANY INCREASE OF PRICE MEANWHILE MANY PREVENTION PROGRAMS ENDEAVOR MIGHTILY WITH SHOE STRING BUDGETS SECOND WE ENOdURAGE EFFORTS AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL AND IN CONGRESS TO ENCOURAGE THE DEVELOPMENT OF EMPLOYEE ASSISTANCE PROGRAMS ESPECIALLY FOR SMALL BUSINESSES IN MICHIGAN HOME THE " BIG THREE THE BIGGEST EMPLOYER IN THE STATE IS THE SMALL BUSINESS BUT MANY THESE ARE UNABLE TO AFFORD THE COSTS OF PROVIDING TREATMENT FOR ABUSING EMPLOYEES MUCH LESS TO AFFORD THE OOSTS OF HEALTH CARE GENERALLY THIRD TOUGHER STREET LEVEL ENFORCEMENT AND STIFFER PENALTIES ARE NEEDED BOTH TO ARREST THOSE INVOLVED IN DRUG TRAFFICKING AS WELL TO SEND /. STRONG MESSAGE TO THE WIDER COMMUNITY WE NEED TO DEVELOP MORE INNOVATIVE WAYS TO DEAL WITH THE DRUG OFFENDER THE FACT PROGRAM MENTIONED EARLIER IS ONE SUCH EXAMPLE WE HAVE ALSO RECENTLY COOPERATED WITH THE MAYOR ’ S OFFICE IN DEVELOPING PLANS A " BOOT CAMP " FOR YOUNG ADULT FELONS WE CANNOT GO ON BUILDING PRISONS FOREVER ESPECIALLY AT A COST OF PER CELL AND ESPECIALLY WHEN POOR SCHOOL DISTRICTS CAN ONLY SPEND ABOUT PER STUDENT FOURTH MENTIONED EARLIER MEASURES OF OUR SUCCESS IN TI c FIGHT AGAINST DRUG ABUSE OUGHT TO INCLUDE OTHER MEASURES THAN DIMPLY THE OVERALL RATE OF REDUCTION IN DRUG USE AND ABUSE —' THESE MEASURES COULD INCLUDE THE NUMBERS OF DRUG ADDICTED INFANTS THE NUMBERS OF DRUG RELATED CRIMES AND INJURIES THE RATE OF TRANSMISSION OF AIDS BY IV DRUG USERS THE NUMBERS OF DRUG RELATED EMERGENCY ROOM ADMISSIONS AND DEATHS FINALLY THE ADMINISTRATION AS WELL CONGRESS WOULD £ WILLING TO OONTINUE ITS DIALOGUE WITH COMMUNITIES AND LOCAL LEADERSHIP SO ADMIRABLY BEGUN IN THE PLANNING AND WRITING THE NATIONAL DRUG OONTROL STRATEGY THE UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN " THINK TANK " THE RAND CORPORATION STUDY PROMISE TO OFFER SOME NEW INSIGHTS AND POSSIBLE APPROACHES TO CONTROLLING DRUG ABUSE ESPECIALLY IN THE AREAS OF PREVENTION AND EDUCATION PARTICIPANTS IN BOTH THESE EFFORTS AS WELL A SOURCE OF FUNDS AND TRAINING FOR COMMUNITY BASED PROGRAMS WE WILL CONTINUE OUR OWN EXPLORATION THE PROBLEM THROUGH REAL LIFE EXPERIENCES AS WELL AS THOUGHTFUL REFLECTION WITHOUT ANY REAL " ANSWER " TO THE DRUG PROBLEM WE A CITY A STATE AND A COUNTRY NEED TO KEEP AN OPEN AND LISTENING MIND TO RESEARCH AND TEST THE VARIOUS " ANSWERS WE HAVE BEFORE US WE WISH TO THANK MEMBERS OF CONGRESS FOR INCREASING THE BUDGET FOR THE NATIONAL DRUG CONTROL STRATEGY ESPECIALLY FOR PREVENTION AND TREATMENT BUT WE HOPE UNLIKE PREVIOUS CAMPAIGNS AGAINST DRUG ABUSE FEDERAL DOLLARS DO NOT DRY UP AFTER THE INITIAL HURRAH WE MUST BE IN THE FIGHT THE LONG HAUL UNTIL WE HAVE PUSHED BACK

Place * Chicago Illinois • JULY FIRST TO THANK CONGRESSMAN JOHN CONYERS CHAIRMAN AND THE HOUSE SUB COHMITTEE ON LEGISLATION AND NATIONAL SECURITY THE COMMITTEE ON GOVERNMENT OPERATIONS THE OPPORTUNITY TO TESTIFY ON THIS VITAL ISSUE CRISIS IN AMERICA DRUG CRISIS IN ILLINOIS AND IN CHICAGO AS WELL AROUND THIS COUNTRY HAS MADE SOME DEFINITE PROGRESS YET NOT NEARLY MUCH AS IS NEEDED TO GET THIS PROBLEM UNDER CONTROL AND TO BE SERIOUS ABOUT DRUGS IN AMERICA AT THE SAME TIME A TREMENDOUS GROUND SWELL COMMON FOLK COMMITTED AND READY AROUND THIS COUNTRY TO STAND UP AND COMBAT THE DRUG PROBLEM FROM THE COMMUNITY LEVEL AND TAKE BACK THEIR NEIGHBORHOODS THIS BE THE ANSWER AND THE COMMUNITY PEOPLE MUST SET THE DIRECTION IF THE DRUG CRISIS WILL EVER BE SOLVED FOLLOWING LIST MY CONCERNS AND SUGGESTIONS WE MUST ACT IMMEDIATELY TO HAVE A FEDERAL DRUG PARAPHERNALIA BILL OUTLAWING THE SALE OF DRUG PARAPHERNALIA THROUGHOUT THE UNITED IT IS INDEED HYPOCRITICAL TO SAY WE A VAR ON DRUGS " YET LEGALIZE THE SALE OF DRUG PARAPHERNALIA IN THROUGHOUT THIS NATION WE MUST CONTINUE TO INVESTIGATE AND PROVIDE AVENUES SUCH AS NUISANCE ABATEMENT * THAT ALLOWS US TO COME DOWN HARD ON PROPERTY CWNERS AND LANDLORDS WHO ALLOW DRUG ACTIVITY TO TAKE PLACE WITHIN THEIR BUILDINGS LIVING FAR AWAY AND OFTEN MAKING AN EXCESS OF RENT TO ALLOW DRUG SALES TO CONTINUE WE MUST PROVIDE THE OPPORUNITIES TO TAKE SUCH PROPERTIES AND WIPE OUT THESE SLUM DRUG LORDS WE MUST DEVISE LEGISLATION THAT TAKES MONIES CAPTURED FROM DRUG RAIDS AND TURNS THEM BACK TO COMMUNITY GROUPS TO PROVIDE NECESSARY EDUCATION AND ORGANIZATION |. WOULD SUGGEST GROUPS BE ALLOWED TO RECEIVE MONIES CONFISCATED FROM THEIR INDIVIDUAL COMMUNITIES TO TURN " African American Catholic Community Faith Education Service ” t AROUND BE PUT RIGHT BACK INTO THESE SAME COMMUNITIES THEREFORE IF COMMUNITY GROUPS HAVE BEEN RESPONSIBLE FOR DRUG BUSTING THEY SHOULO RECEIVE THE CONFISCATED FUNDS TO CONTINUE IN THEIR OESIGNATEO AREAS MUST BE POSITIVE REINFORCEMENT AND AFFIRMATION OF YOUNG WHO REMAINED DRUG FREE AND GANG FREE WE CAN T SIMPLY COME DOWN ON THE ORUG USERS AND NEVER GIVE CREDIT OR AFFIRMATION TO THE ORUG FREE YOUTH WE NEED TO INVESTIGATE SUCH SUCCESSFUL PROGRAMS AS KILGORE TEXAS THAT HAS DEVELOPED DISCOUNTS IN STORES AND FAST FOOD RESTAURANTS FOR DRUG FREE YOUTH WE MUST BEGIH TO DEVELOP ALTERNATIVE PROGRAMS IN GRAMMAR SCHOOLS ANO HIGH SCHOOLS FOR YOUNG PEOPLE TO GET INVOLVED AFTER SCHOOL AND EVENINGS IN A SOCIETY OF SO MAflY SINGLE PARENTS AND WORKING PARENTS TIME ON HAND TO YOUNG PEOPLE IS TIME VULNERABLE TO NEGATIVE INFLUENCES AND ACTIVITIES WE CANNOT SIMPLY TELL OUR YOUNG PEOPLE TO JUST SAY NO BUT WE MUST PROVIDE THE POSITIVE ALTERNATIVE ACTIVITIES IN A WIDE ANO VARIED SCALE TO SAY YES TO • WE MUST OEVELOP A COMPREHENSIVE ORUG EDUCATION PROGRAM COMPOSED BY EXPERTS IN THE EDUCATIONAL ANO COMMUNICATION FIELDS ANO THEN MANDATE A BASIC PROGRAM FOR ALL PAROCHIAL PRIVATE AND PUBLIC SCHOOLS KINDERGARTEN THROUGH SENIOR YEAR OF HIGH SCHOOL TO GIVE OUR YOUNG PEOPLE THE KNOWLEDGE THEY NEED WE MUST MANDATE DRUG EDUCATION TO RECEIVE A DIPLOMA JUST ORIVERS EDUCATION IS NEEDED A DRIVERS LICENSE INCLUDED IN THIS MUST BE SOME BASIC MANDATORY EDUCATION FOR PARENTS AND FOR COMMUNITY MEMBERS GROUP OF RELIGIOUS LEAOERS NEED TO DEVELOP A PROGRAM OF EDUCATION AND ACTION TO BE DISTRIBUTED TO CHURCH LEADERS OF AIL RELIGIOUS DENOMINATIONS CHURCHES MUST PLAY A DOMINANT POSITION IN THE DRUG CRISIS SOLUTION • STRONG PRESSURE SHOULD BE PUT ON THE MEDIA TV ., RADIO AND MUSIC INDUSTRY WHO HAVE PLAYED A MAJOR AND INFLUENTIAL ROLE IN GLAMORIZING ORUGS ALCOHOL ANO TOBACCO TO OUR YOUTH THEY MUST NOW BE RESPONSIBLE FOR REVERSING THE NEGATIVE TREND THEY HIGH PROFILED TREATMENT PROGRAMS MUST BE MADE AVAILABLE IMMEDIATELY TO THOSE MO CANNOT AFFORO THE HIGH PRICE OF ORUG TREATMENT AND WHO NO INSURANCE TO PAY FOR IT HOST MAJOR CITIES HAVE EIGHT MONTH TO SIXTEEN MONTH WAITING LISTS FOR ADDICTS SEEKING HELP IT MAKES NO SENSE TO SAY WE A SERIOUS WAR ON DRUGS AND CANNOT PROVIDE HELP TO THE THOUSANDS WHO TO GET OFF DRUGS PRESSURE SHOUU COME DOWN ON NEWS MEDIA TO STOP STEREOTYPING THE ORUG CRISIS IN AMERICA AN AFRICAN AMERICAN AND HISPANIC PROBLEM THIS FIRST A LIE AND SECOND RACIST ANO THIRD CONTINUING THE SERIOUS PROBLEM OF DENIAL THAT SO PRESENT IN WHITE COMMUNITIES THROUGHOUT THIS COUNTRY THE ORUG CRISIS IS AN AMERICAN PROBLEM provioe treatment WE NOW HAVE INCARCERATED STAND AGAINST BUILDING MORE WHAT ALREADY NOT WORKING LET S CORRECT WHAT WE HAVE FIRST COOK COUNTY JAIL HAS APPROXIMATELY INMATES NEARLY * THE INMATES HAVE ARRESTS CONNECTED WITH DRUGS YET ONLY INMATES CAN RECEIVE DRUG TREATMENT THIS SCANDAL OUR PRISONS ALSO NEEO ORUG TREATMENT SO INMATES WON T RETURN TO SOCIETY WITH THE SAME PROBLEM THAT THEM INTO THE PENAL INSTITUTIONS WE MUST GET SERIOUS THE ARREST AND CONVICTION THE THREE PIECE SUIT DRUG WHO ARE BRINGING ORGANIZING AND LAUNDERING DRUGS ANO DRUG MONIES IN OUR CITIES WE ON ARRESTING AND CONVICTING THE STREET TEEN OEALER TO ARREST MASSES OF STREET TEENS GIVES AN APPEARANCE OF CLEANING UP THE DRUG PROBLEM THE DOWNTOWN SUPPLIER IS ERADICATED THE DRUG PROBLEM ISN T TOUCHED LIKE TO SEE ONE THREE PIECE SUIT DRUG SUPPLIER WHO SITS BEHIND A DESK WITH CLEAN HANDS BE ARRESTED FOR EVERY TEEN STREET CORNER DEALER ORUGS CONTINUE TO BE ONE THE MAJOR EMPLOYERS IN POVERTY STRICKEN COMMUNITIES JOBS MUST BE FOUND ANO MADE AVAILABLE AND ECONOMIC JUSTICE A REALITY IF THE DRUG EMPLOYER IS TO EVER BE OUT OF BUSINESS GOVERNMENT MUST PROVIOE THE MONIES AND NECESSARY SUPPORT TO ALLOW NETWORKING TO BE DONE IN THE CITIES SO THAT ORGANIZATIONS ANO COMMUNITY GROUPS ARE NOT CONTINUING TO RE WHEEL CAN AID AND SUPPORT EACH OTHER ANO MAKE RESOURCES AVAILABLE TO EACH OTHER THERE IS STRENGTH AND SUCCESS IN NETWORKING AND UNITY • EACH MAJOR CITY NEEDS ITS OWN ORUG COORDINATOR AND TASK FORCE TO DIRECT THE ALLEVIATION OF ORUGS FOR THEIR CITY ARE MANY ORGANIZATIONAL SKILLS AND ORGANIZING MATERIALS THAT CAN BE GIVEN AND TAUGHT TO BLOCK CLUBS CHURCHES ANO LOCAL COMMUNITY GROUPS THIS INFORMATION NEEDS TO BE COMPILED AND GIVEN OUT AND TRAINING SESSIONS OFFERED SO THAT COMMUNITY GROUPS CAN HAVE HANDS ON AND CONCRETE DIRECTION TO STAND UP AND TAKE BACK THEIR COMMUNITIES WE MUST ALSO DEAL IN AN AGGRESSIVE WAY WITH OUR ALCOHOL AND T08ACC0 PROBLEM IT A PROVEN FACT THEY THE GATEWAY PRODUCTS TO THE ILLEGAL DRUGS % r sv LAST YEAR A HALF WITH THE ORUG PROBLEMS HERE AND IN OTHER CITIES THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY WITH THE NUMBER OF STORIES FROM AODICTS THEY

SURGEON GENERAL REPORT OR THAN PER DAY OIE A RESULT SMOKING IF TWO FULLY LOAOED JETS CRASHED EVERY DAY WITH NO SURVIVORS THEY WOULD BE KILLING LESS PEOPLE THAN CIGARETTES IF THIS HAPPENED WE WOULD BE
