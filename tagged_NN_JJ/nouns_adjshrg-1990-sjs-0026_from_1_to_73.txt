JULY * MR CHAIRMAN THANK YOU FOR HOLDING THIS HEARING TODAY ON THE SUBJECT THE RISING MURDER RATE IN OUR COUNTRY TO THANK OUR WITNESSES WHO HAVE TRAVELED HERE TO HELP SHED SOME LIGHT ON THIS TRAGIC OCCURRENCE MURDER CRIME WE UNFORTUNATELY HEAR AND READ ALL TOO MUCH ABOUT TURN T V OR RADIO OR PICK UP ANY NEWSPAPER AND YOU RE LIKELY TO BE TOLD A MURDER THAT OCCURRED WHETHER IT WAS IN NEW YORK OR L A A RURAL AREA IN IOWA OR A FEW BLOCKS FROM WHERE WE SIT TODAY THOSE WHO LIVE AND WORK IN THIS AREA ARE ALL TOO AWARE THAT WASHINGTON D C IS KNOWN THE " MURDER CAPITAL " THE WORLD BUT EVEN THE MURDER RATE TRAGICALLY SOARS UPWARD SOCIETY SEEMS TO BE NUMBED TO THE VIOLENT OCCURRENCES ON OUR STREETS FOR IT REALLY HITS HOME AND SOMEONE WE KNOW A VICTIM LESS AND LESS THOUGHT IS GIVEN TO THE REPORT A MURDER OCCURRING FOR MANY PEOPLE MURDER UNFORTUNATELY HAS BECOME A FACT OF LIFE BUT THAT BRINGS ME BACK TO WHY WE ARE HERE TODAY TO EXAMINE WHY THE MURDER RATE HAS RISEN SO DRAMATICALLY IN EXAMINING THE CRIME OF MURDER ONE QUICKLY IS MADE AWARE IT COMPLEX CRIME IT COMPLEX BECAUSE MANY FACTORS ARE INVOLVED CONSIDERATION MUST BE GIVEN TO ALL THESE FACTORS WHETHER WE BLAME IT ON GUNS DRUGS A LACK OF ADEQUATE LAW ENFORCEMENT A LACK OF AN EFFECTIVE CRIMINAL DETERRENT THE NUMBER OF PERSONS IN A CERTAIN AGE BRACKET IN A CERTAIN REGION OR ANY A HUNDRED OTHER CAUSES IT STILL MUST BE ADMITTED MATTER WHAT ACTION IS TAKEN BY THE CONGRESS IT S NOT GOING TO MAKE A BIT OF DIFFERENCE UNLESS WE SOCIETY TEACH AND DEMAND OF OTHERS A RESPECT FOR HUMAN LIFE BUT WE DEMAND RESPECT FOR HUMAN LIFE WE MUST ALSO RECOGNIZE WHAT OTHER FACTORS MAY CONTRIBUTE TO THE MURDER RATE SOME BOTH THE NUMBER OF GUNS AND THE TYPE OF GUNS IN OUR STREETS TODAY CONTRIBUTES TO THE INCREASE IN THE MURDER RATE IN THE U S HOWEVER WE SHOULD ALL BE KEENLY AWARE IT IS NOT THE NUMBER OF GUNS OR THE TYPE OF GUNS BEING USED RATHER IT THE CRIMINALS WHO USE THEM CRIMINALS IT S NOT THE LAW ABIDING NEIGHBOR NEXT DOOR WHO PURSUES HUNTING A SPORT OR GUN COLLECTING A HOBBY WHO A CAUSE THE RISING MURDER RATE CANNOT EMPHASIZE ENOUGH IT THE CRIMINAL THE SECOND AMENDMENT TO THE U S CONSTITUTION DEMANDS IT NOT THE LAW ABIDING CITIZEN S RIGHTS THAT SHOULD BE SACRIFICED IN OUR EFFORT TO REDUCE THE MURDER RATE SOME MAY SUGGEST THAT IN LOOKING OUT THE COMMON GOOD ALL OF SOCIETY WE MUST REDUCE THE NUMBER OF GUNS IN OUR COUNTRY HANDS OF CRIMINALS AND LAW ABIDING CITIZENS ALIKE IN ORDER TO REDUCE THE MURDER RATE THE THEORY IS THAT IF THERE ARE FEWER GUNS THERE BE FEWER CRIMES COMMITTED WITH GUNS NOT ONLY THIS AN INFRINGEMENT ON CONSTITUTIONALLY GUARANTEED RIGHTS IT WON T WORK ANYWAY WE ALL KNOW THAT CRIMINALS DON T OBEY THE LAW AND WE ALL KNOW THAT A CRIMINAL WON T CARE IF IT S LEGAL OR ILLEGAL TO OWN A GUN A CRIMINAL HAS NO RESPECT THE LAW AND WILL CONTINUE TO OBTAIN AND USE A GUN IN WHATEVER MANNER HE WHETHER IT ’ S TO USE A THREAT TO ROB THE NEIGHBORHOOD GROCERY TO MURDER AN ENEMY OR TO KILL AN INNOCENT VICTIM TO TRY TO REDUCE THE MURDER RATE BY PROHIBITING THE OWNERSHIP OF CERTAIN FIREARMS WILL HAVE NO EFFECT ON THE MURDER RATE BUT IT WILL AFFECT THOSE CITIZENS LAW WAS DESIGNED TO PROTECT THOSE WHO OWN AND USE GUNS FOR LEGAL PURPOSES IT IS IMPORTANT TO REMEMBER THAT LAWS ARE ENACTED TO PROTECT LAW ABIDING CITIZENS NOT TO PUNISH THEM BECAUSE A CRIMINAL S CHOICE OF WEAPON TO DO OTHERWISE TURNS THESE CITIZENS INTO INNOCENT VICTIMS IN OUR WAR AGAINST CRIME WE EVEN TURN LAW ABIDING CITIZENS INTO CRIMINALS OVERNIGHT THAT WRONG CAN BE DONE ANSWER IS NOT TO RESTRICT AN INDIVIDUAL S RIGHT TO POSSESS A FIREARM INSTEAD WE MUST DETER CRIMINALS FROM USING GUNS BY INCREASING THE PENALTIES FOR THE ILLEGAL USE OF GUNS SOME THE ENHANCED PENALTY PROVISIONS OF TITLE IV THE SENATE S RECENTLY ENACTED CRIME BILL MAY PROVIDE US WITH A GOOD START THE NECESSITY A DETERRENT TO PREVENT CRIMINALS FROM COMMITTING VIOLENT CRIMES IF WE TO REDUCE THE MURDER RATE WE TO CONVINCE CRIMINALS THE PUNISHMENT FOR KILLING IS SO SEVERE AND VERY CERTAIN IT ’ S NOT WORTH THE RISK OF BEING CAUGHT THAT DEATH PENALTY W £ STRENGTHENED THE FEDERAL DEATH PENALTY IN THE SENATE CRIME BILL THIS STEP IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION BUT WE TO MAKE CRIMINALS AWARE THIS ULTIMATE CRIMINAL SANCTION BE ENFORCED IT WILL NOT BE POSSIBLE FOR THEM TO EVADE THEIR PUNISHMENT BY PURSUING REPETITIVE APPEALS THAT NOTHING TO DO WITH THEIR FACTUAL GUILT OR INNOCENCE THAT S WHY IS SUPPORTED THE CHANGES IN FEDERAL HABEAS CORPUS PROCEDURES CONTAINED IN THE SENATE CRIME BILL THIS PROVISION NOT A PERFECT COMPROMISE ITS AUTHORS SENATORS SPECTER AND THURMOND HAVE PROVIDED US WITH A NEEDED FIRST STEP TOWARD REAL REFORM HEARTENED WE INCREASED OUR EFFORTS TO STOP THE ILLEGAL DRUG TRADE FROM OVERTAKING OUR SOCIETY WE DONE SO HOWEVER THE DRUG TRADE HAS BECOME MORE COMPETITIVE THIS FIERCER COMPETITION HAS LIKELY CAUSED AN INCREASING RATE OF CRIME AND MURDER IN THE DRUG WAR BECAUSE HOPEFULLY CRIMINALS HAVE ACCESS TO FEWER DRUGS AND FEWER CUSTOMERS IT CAN ONLY BE CONCLUDED THEN THAT A CRIMINAL WILL RESORT TO MORE DRASTIC MEASURES TO PROTECT HIS OR HER TURF THIS MAY BE PROOF WE ARE INDEED SUCCEEDING IN DRYING THE DRUG TRADE WE CANNOT GIVE UP HERE WE MUST CONTINUE TO EXERT PRESSURE ON THE AND USERS UNTIL WE HAVE RID OUR SOCIETY THE DRUG PLAGUE IN HEARINGS ON RELATED TOPICS BEFORE THE WAR ON DRUGS AS WELL THE WAR ON VIOLENT CRIME WILL ONLY BE WON WHEN INDIVIDUAL VALUES AND ATTITUDES TOWARDS ALL CRIMINAL ACTIVITY HOLD THAT CRIME IS IMMORAL AND INTOLERABLE SUCH VALUES MUST BEGIN AT HOME AND IN THE COMMUNITY TO HEARING OUR WITNESSES THEY SHARE
