MORKING TO DISCUSS THE TERRIBLE EFFECT THE CRACK EPIDEMIC IS HAVING ON OUR NATION S SENIOR CITIZENS WE ARE HERE TODAY BECAUSE THIS TIME OF EMERGENCY OF CRISIS CRACK HAS CAUSED DEVASTATION TO THOUSANDS OF ELDERLY PEOPLE JUST IT HAS DESTROYED SO MANY OTHER LIVES COMMUNITIES AND NEIGHBORHOODS LIKE PERSONNEL BOMBS CRACK EXPLODES IN FAMILIES SCATTERING DEADLY FRAGMENTS INTO THE BODIES OF EVERYONE AROUND AS DISTRICT ATTORNEY THE MOST POPULOUS BOROUGH IN NEW YORK CITY EFFECTS OF CRACK ON OUR SENIOR CITIZENS EVERY DAY ENORMOUS RISE IN DRUG RELATED VIOLENT CRIMES COMMITTED AGAINST ELDERLY VICTIMS IN THE INCREASING ISOLATION THE FRAIL ELDERLY IN DANGEROUS CRACK INFESTED NEIGHBORHOODS AND IN THE SOARING NUMBER OF GRANDPARENTS WHO MUST RAISE GRANDCHILDREN ABANDONED OR ABUSED BY THEIR CRACK ADDICTED PARENTS MOST SERIOUS EFFECTS OF CRACK HAS BEEN THE INCREASE IN THE CASES OF VIOLENCE AGAINST ELDERLY PEOPLE BY YOUNGER MEMBERS OF THEIR FAMILY LET ME BEGIN BY DISCUSSING THIS PROBLEM THESE CASES HAVE NOT MADE THE FRONT PAGES AS DISTRICT ATTORNEY TO DEAL WITH INCREASING NUMBERS OF CASES OF INTRAFAMILY VIOLENCE RESULTING FROM CRACK TO MY HORROR THAT NO BOND OF LOVE CAN STAND IN THE WAY OF CRACK — THAT w — HUNDREDS EVEN THOUSANDS OF OLDER NEW NOW VULNERABLE TO MURDER TO ASSAULT BY THEIR CHILDREN GRANDCHILDREN OR GREATGRANDCHILDREN DESPERATE FOR THEIR NEXT FIX OF CRACK PROBLEM FIRST CAME TO MY ATTENTION IN WHEN MY OFFICE HANDLED THE CASE OF A YOUNG MAN WHO ASKED HIS MOTHER TO GIVE HIM MONEY FOR CRACK ANY GOOD SENSIBLE MOTHER SHE HIM " NO ". OUTRAGED AT THE REJECTION HER SON THEN TIED HER TO A BED SET THE ROOM ON FIRE BARRICADED THE DOOR TO PREVENT HER FROM ESCAPING AND LEFT HER TO DIE TOO ARE VULNERABLE SIMILAR CASE IN WHICH ANOTHER YOUNG MAN APPROACHED HIS FATHER FOR MONEY FOR CRACK HE TOO REFUSED JUST LIKE ANY SENSIBLE PARENT WOULD THE SON FURIOUS ATTACKED WITH A HAMMER BASHING HIS FATHER REPEATEDLY ON HIS HEAD AND FRACTURING HIS RIBS AND ARMS THESE CASES ARE HORRIFYING WORSE STILL THE PROBLEM IS GROWING MUSHROOMING JUST THE CRACK EPIDEMIC IN MY OFFICE HANDLED ALMOST % CASES OF VIOLENT ATTACKS ON ELDERS THAN WE HAD IN YEAR THE CRACK EPIDEMIC BEGAN CASES IN COMPARED TO CASES IN ). THE NUMBERS ARE REMAINING AT THE SAME HIGH LEVELS CASES AS OF OCTOBER THESE ARE NOT JUST NUMBERS — THEY REFLECT BRUTAL ATTACKS ON MOTHERS FATHERS GRANDPARENTS UNCLES AND AUNTS WHOSE LIVES HAVE BEEN DESTROYED BY SENSELESS VIOLENCE EACH CASE REPRESENTS A SHATTERED FAMILY A BROKEN RELATIONSHIP OF TRUST THESE NUMBERS ARE ONLY THE TIP THE ICEBERG VIOLENT ATTACKS REPRESENT ONLY ONE OF THE MANY FORMS ELDER ABUSE MAY TAKE ARE ALSO SUBJECT TO FINANCIAL EXPLOITATION NEGLECT DEPRIVATION OF ESSENTIAL SERVICES SUCH FOOD CLOTHING MEDICATION ABANDONMENT AND PSYCHOLOGICAL ABUSE WHEN YOU CONSIDER ONLY VIOLENT ATTACKS THE NUMBERS OF CASES OF ABUSE ARE SIGNIFICANTLY UNDERSTATED BY THE STATISTICS PROBLEM IS VASTLY UNDERREPORTED THE RESPONSE OF PARENTS AND GRANDPARENTS WHO BEEN ATTACKED IS NOT VERY DIFFERENT FROM THAT OTHER VICTIMS OF INTRAFAMILY VIOLENCE LIKE WIVES WHO ARE BATTERED PARENTS GRANDPARENTS ARE DEEPLY ASHAMED THE VIOLENCE VISITED UPON THEM BY THEIR OFFSPRING OFTEN THEY BLAME THEMSELVES BELIEVING THEY MUST BE AT FAULT THE BATTERING FURTHERMORE MANY THE VICTIMS DO NOT WANT TO SEE THEIR CHILD OR GRANDCHILD PUNISHED THEY JUST VIOLENCE TO END RESULT THESE CRIMES FREQUENTLY WON T BE REPORTED AT ALL AND WHEN THEY ARE REPORTED IT IS USUALLY ONLY WHEN THE VIOLENCE HAS BECOME VERY SERIOUS EVEN LIFE THREATENING ARE OTHER REASONS THAT ELDER ABUSE MAY NOT BE REPORTED MAY BE UNAWARE OF PROFESSIONAL AGENCIES SUCK AS SOCIAL SERVICE OR LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES WHICH ARE AVAILABLE TO ASSIST THEM THEY MAY THINK THEIR PLIGHT IS UNIQUE OR THEY NOT KNOW WHERE TO TURN FOR HELP FINALLY THEY MAY BE AFRAID OF RETALIATION IF THEY TAKE ACTION AGAINST THEIR ABUSER ELDERLY ‘ VICTIMS MAY BE ENTIRELY DEPENDENT ON THEIR ABUSIVE CHILDREN FOR MEDICATION AND A PLACE TO LIVE THEY MAY BE FRIGHTENED HELPLESS AND VULNERABLE THEY MAY BE AFRAID THEY BE LEFT ALONE WITH NO ONE TO CARE FOR THEM IF THEY REPORT ABUSE OTHER ELDERLY VICTIMS MAY HAVE FEW OUTSIDE CONTACTS THEY MAY NOT WORK THEY MAY NEVER EVEN GO OUTDOORS OR SEE THEIR THE PROBLEM OF ELDER ABUSE IS HOT CONFINED TO NEW YORK OR TO CITIES IT A NATIONAL PROBLEM AN MILLION PEOPLE OVER AGE ARE ABUSED NEGLECTED OR EXPLOITED EACH YEAR OUR POPULATION AGES CHANGING DEMOGRAPHICS HILL MAKE VICTIMIZATION THE ELDERLY INCREASE DRAMATICALLY BY THE TURN THE CENTURY BY YEAR * OF AMERICANS HILL BE YEARS OR OLDER THE GREATEST INCREASE HILL BE IN THOSE OLD — HHICH INCLUDES SOME THE MOST PHYSICALLY MENTALLY AND FINANCIALLY VULNERABLE PEOPLE PROBLEM OF ELDER ABUSE CANNOT BE IGNORED ABUSED ARE IN URGENT NEED OF HELP — BOTH TO STOP THE ABUSE AND PROSECUTE THE OFFENDER AND TO PROVIDE THEM HITH COUNSELING AND OTHER VITAL SERVICES BUT HE CANNOT BEGIN TO ADDRESS THE PROBLEM OF ELDER ABUSE UNTIL ITS VICTIMS HAVE BEEN IDENTIFIED SINCE THE REASONS MENTIONED VICTIMS OFTEN CANNOT OR HILL NOT REPORT THE ABUSE HE MUST USE OTHER MEANS TO IDENTIFY THOSE IN NEED OF HELP FIRST HE MUST OBTAIN THE ASSISTANCE THE MEDICAL COMMUNITY SINCE MANY THE ABUSED ELDERLY ARE FORCED TO SEEK MEDICAL ATTENTION FOR THEIR INJURIES HOSPITAL VISITS MAY BE THE ONLY CHANCE FOR AN OLDER VICTIM TO GET HELP DOCTORS OFTEN REPRESENT AN ABUSED ELDER S ONLY CONNECTION HITH THE OUTSIDE HORLD TRAINING MEDICAL PERSONNEL IS PARTICULARLY IMPORTANT THE ELDERLY VICTIM MAY EXPLAIN AWAY INJURIES CAUSED BY ABUSE FOR AND DOCTORS MAY NOT IMAGINE THAT FAMILY VIOLENCE COULD BE THE CAUSE THE INJURIES WITH CASES OF CHILD ABUSE HEALTH PROFESSIONALS MUST BE TRAINED TO BLEND MEDICINE WITH DETECTIVE WORX LOOKING AT X RAYS FOR SIGNS OF OLD INJURIES AND CAREFULLY AND SENSITIVELY PATIENT ABOUT IMPLAUSIBLE EXPLANATIONS FOR THEIR INJURIES IN JULY TO NEW YORK CITY HOSPITALS CALLING ON THEM TO TRAIN THEIR DOCTORS NURSES AND SOCIAL WORKERS TO RECOGNIZE SIGNS OF ELDER ABUSE AND TAKE APPROPRIATE ACTIONS TO DEAL WITH THE PROBLEM SADLY ONLY FOUR RESPONDED NOTING THEY SUCH TRAINING PROGRAMS OR WERE INSTITUTING THEM THE BRIGHTER SIDE PLEASED TO REPORT THAT IN RESPONSE TO MY CALL THE CITY S HEALTH AND HOSPITALS CORPORATION INITIATED A PILOT PROGRAM TO TRAIN ITS HOSPITAL EMERGENCY ROOM STAFF SOCIAL WORKERS AND OTHER PERSONNEL TO RECOGNIZE AND TREAT CASES OF ELDER ABUSE THE PILOT PROGRAM WAS INSTITUTED AT THREE ACUTE CARE HOSPITALS TWO NEIGHBORHOOD FAMILY CARE AND TWO CERTIFIED HOME HEALTH AGENCIES ALL IN THE BRONX THIS AN IMPORTANT START BUT IT STILL LEAVES MOST ELDERLY VICTIMS UNPROTECTED THE PILOT PROGRAM HAS BEEN EVALUATED ONLY THE PILOT PROGRAM HOSPITALS WILL RECEIVE TRAINING THERE BE TRAINING IN ANY THE OTHER CITY HOSPITALS OR THE OTHER VOLUNTARY OR PRIVATE HOSPITALS THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT CAN AND SHOULD HELP ENCOURAGE THE DEVELOPMENT OF TRAINING PROGRAMS IN MEDICAL SCHOOLS AND HOSPITALS ELDERLY TOO MUST BE EDUCATED THEY MUST BE INFORMED THE KIND OF HELP THAT AVAILABLE AND THEY MUST BE REASSURED THAT IP THEY REPORT THEIR ABUSE THEY BE FROM RETALIATION THEY MUST ALSO BE ASSURED THEY HAVE SOME OTHER PLACE TO TURN TO FOR FOOD CLOTHING SHELTER AND PERSONAL CARE IF THEY REPORT ABUSE BY A FAMILY MEMBER WHO CARES FOR THEM DOCTORS NURSES SOCIAL AND OTHER PROFESSIONALS WHO COME INTO CONTACT WITH THE ELDERLY MUST BE REQUIRED TO REPORT INSTANCES OF ABUSE MANDATORY REPORTING REQUIREMENT FOR CHILD ABUSE AND ALSO ONE FOR ELDER ABUSE UNFORTUNATELY NEW YORK IS ONE THE FEW THAT NOT IT IS JOINED BY COLORADO ILLINOIS NORTH AND SOUTH DAKOTA AND PENNSYLVANIA YEAR MY OFFICE DRAFTED A MANDATORY REPORTING LAW FOR NEW YORK STATE WHICH WAS INTRODUCED IN THE NEW YORK STATE LEGISLATURE THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT SHOULD ENCOURAGE THE DEVELOPMENT NATIONWIDE OF MANDATORY REPORTING IDENTIFICATION ALONE SOLVES ONLY PART THE PROBLEM WHEN COURAGE TO REPORT ABUSE WE MUST ASSURE THEY HELP THEY NEED EXISTING FOR THE ELDERLY ARE WOEFULLY INADEQUATE IN MANY RESPECTS FOR EXAMPLE IN NEW YORK CITY CASEWORKERS FOR PROTECTIVE SERVICES FOR ADULTS THE AGENCY CHARGED WITH PROVIDING CARE TO DEPENDENT ABUSED ADULTS THE AGE OF ARE HANDLING CASELOADS APPROXIMATELY TWICE AS HIGH THOSE RECOMMENDED BY THE NEW YORX PUBLIC WELFARE ASSOCIATION UPSTATE PROTECTIVE SERVICE HAVE CASELOADS EVEN HIGHER THAN THAT SOME CASELOADS AS HIGH CASES PER WORKER THIS CLEARLY UNACCEPTABLE CASEWORKERS SIMPLY CANNOT BEGIN TO INVESTIGATE ALL THE CASES THAT EXIST NOW NUMBERS KEEP RISING CLIENT NUMBERS ROSE « FROM TO THE REASONS NEW YORK STATE S PROGRAM OF PROTECTIVE SERVICES FOR ADULTS IS SO UNDERFUNDED THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT HAS NOT BEEN PAYING ITS FAIR SHARE DURING THE REAGAN YEARS SOCIAL SERVICES BLOCK GRANTS WERE CUT BACK DRAMATICALLY BLOCK GRANTS HAVE NOW BEGUN TO INCREASE THEY HAVE NOT INCREASED NEARLY ENOUGH TO MAKE UP THE DAMAGE THAT WAS DONE LOCALITIES WERE FORCED TO FUND LARGER AND LARGER SHARES OF SOCIAL SERVICE COSTS AND THOSE COSTS HAVE SKYROCKETED THE • \ FEDERAL MONEY NOW COMING IN TO NEW YORK STATE FOR SOCIAL SERVICE BLOCK GRANTS STILL DOES NOT EVEN COVER % THE COSTS OF SERVICES MANDATED BY STATE AND FEDERAL LAWS LOCALITIES WHICH CANNOT AFFORD TO FUND THESE SERVICES FACE THE SPECTER OF WORSENING CARE FOR THEIR ELDERLY POPULATION THIS CANNOT CONTINUE PROTECTIVE SERVICES FOR ADULTS — AND SIMILAR AGENCIES IN CITIES AND THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY — MUST BE GIVEN THE RESOURCES TO DO THE JOB SIMILARLY THERE A PATHETIC LACK OF SHELTERS FOR DOMESTIC VIOLENCE VICTIMS IN NEW YORK STATE THOSE EXIST — JUST ARE CROWDED WITH DESPERATE FAMILIES AND ARE INAPPROPRIATE FOR OLDER VICTIMS SPECIAL MUST BE AVAILABLE TO HOUSE VICTIMS WHOSE LIVES ARE ENDANGERED BY ELDER ABUSE THESE SHELTERS WOULD ACCOMMODATE PHYSICAL DISABILITIES AND TAKE INTO ACCOUNT THE SPECIAL DIETARY AND MEDICAL NEEDS THE ELDERLY TREMENDOUS ARE NEEDED TO PROVIDE ADEQUATE SUPPORT SERVICES THE ELDERLY IN THIS COUNTRY THIS AN AREA IN WHICH THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT COULD BE MOST HELPFUL BY INCREASING SOCIAL BUT EVEN MORE HAS TO BE DONE RESEARCH IS NECESSARY TO DETERMINE MORE PRECISELY THE NATURE AND PREVALENCE OF ELDER ABUSE TRAINING EDUCATION ARE NEEDED TO MAKE AMERICANS MORE AWARE THE PROBLEM AND MORE SENSITIVE TO THE SPECIAL NEEDS OF ELDER ABUSE VICTIMS LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES NEED TO CREATE SPECIALLY TRAINED UNITS TO HANDLE THESE CASES IN MY OFFICE FOR EXAMPLE ALL ELDER ABUSE CASES ARE HANDLED BY A PARTICULAR BUREAU THE SEX CRIMES / SPECIAL VICTIMS BUREAU STAFFED WITH SPECIALLY TRAINED ASSISTANTS ASSISTANTS RECEIVE TRAINING IN AMONG OTHER THINGS THE SPECIAL NEEDS OF ELDERLY VICTIMS FINALLY VICTIMS NEED TO BE SHOWN THERE ARE OPTIONS THAT NO ONE HAS TO ENDURE A LIFE OF DREAD AND SUFFERING IF THEY CANNOT IMAGINE PUTTING THEIR CHILD IN JAIL ARE ALTERNATIVES MY OFFICE FOR INSTANCE WILL HELP PLACE THEIR DRUG ABUSING CHILDREN IN TREATMENT WE CAN GET ELDERLY VICTIMS AN ORDER OF PROTECTION AND PROVIDE PSYCHOLOGICAL COUNSELING COURT ORDERED COUNSELING PROGRAMS SHOULD BE CREATED AND FUNDED TO COUNSEL NON ADDICTED DEFENDANTS CONVICTED BATTERING THEIR ELDERS AN INCREASE IN DRUG TREATMENT FACILITIES IS ALSO CRUCIAL TO PERSUADE ELDERLY PERSONS TO GO FORWARD WITH THE PROSECUTION AND TO PREVENT FURTHER VICTIMIZATION INCREASE IN ELDERLY PEOPLE ABUSED BY THEIR DRUG ADDICTED RELATIVES IS UNFORTUNATELY ONLY ONE THE TERRIBLE EFFECTS OF CRACK ON THE ELDERLY ANOTHER INCREASE IN DRUG RELATED CRIME AGAINST THE ELDERLY BY STRANGERS CRACK RELATED VIOLENCE HAS INCREASED DRAMATICALLY AGAINST hLL VICTIMS IN THE YEARS SINCE ACCORDING TO POLICE % OF NEW YORK CITY S NOW DRUG RELATED COMPARED TO % IN AND THE NUMBER OF MURDERS IS UP TOO — TO OVER IN VIOLENT CRIMES RELATED TO DRUG TRAFFICKING AND DRUG ABUSE ROBBERY AND AGGRAVATED ASSAULT WERE UP AS WELL IN WERE ROBBERIES IN NEW YORK CITY UP % THE ROBBERIES IN AGGRAVATED ASSAULT ROSE % DURING THE SAME PERIOD FROM TO THE BEEN INCREASING STEADILY SINCE PRIOR TO CRIME RATE BEEN DECREASING STUDY OF MANHATTAN DEFENDANTS ARRESTED FOR SERIOUS CRIMES SHOWED % TESTED POSITIVE FOR COCAINE FROM ONLY % IN HAVE NOT BEEN EXEMPTED FROM THIS SPATE OF DRUG RELATED CRIMES MURDERS ROBBERIES BURGLARIES AND ASSAULTS ARE COMMITTED WITH ALARMING FREQUENCY AGAINST ELDERLY VICTIMS BY STRANGERS WHO VIEW THEM EASY PREY MY OFFICE RECENTLY CASE IN WHICH A YEAR OLD WOMAN WAS BEATEN AND STRANGLED TO DEATH IN HER APARTMENT BY A MAN SEEKING MONEY FOR DRUGS THE VICTIM LAY DEAD LOCKED IN A CLOSET HER KILLER MADE REPEATED TRIPS TO THE PAWN SHOP WITH ITEMS STOLEN FROM HER APARTMENT CITYWIDE CRIMES AGAINST THE ELDERLY REMAIN AT HIGH LEVELS IN ALMOST CRIMES WERE REPORTED WITH BURGLARIES ROBBERIES AND ASSAULTS MAKING UP OVER THESE CRIMES MANY THESE ARE DRUG RELATED ELDERLY ARE PARTICULARLY LIKELY TO BE VICTIMS OF DRUG RELATED CRIMES BECAUSE THEIR FRAILTY MAKES THEM LESS MOBILE AND LESS LIKELY TO SUCCESSFULLY RESIST THEIR ATTACKERS ANOTHER FACTOR IN THE HIGH VICTIMIZATION RATE IS THAT MANY ELDERLY VICTIMS ARE POOR AND LIVE IN CRIME RIDDEN DRUG INFESTED NEIGHBORHOODS FROM WHICH THEY CANNOT AFFORD TO MOVE OUT DRUG TAKEN SUCH NEIGHBORHOODS HOSTAGE AND TURNED THEM INTO WAR ZONES ACCORDING THE DRUG ENFORCEMENT ADMINISTRATION DURING WERE AT LEAST INSTANCES IN NEW YORK CITY IN WHICH INNOCENT BYSTANDERS WERE HIT BY STRAY BULLETS DURING DRUG RELATED GUNFIGHTS EIGHTEEN WERE KILLED WERE WOUNDED IN THESE INCIDENTS ACCORDING THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT THE ELDERLY ARE MORE LIKELY THAN VICTIMS UNDER AGE TO BE VICTIMIZED AT OR NEAR THEIR OWN HOMES — % COMPARED TO %. EVEN FOR THOSE WHO ARE NOT VICTIMIZED THE PSYCHOLOGICAL EFFECT THE VIOLENCE ASSOCIATED WITH DRUG TRAFFICKING IS DEVASTATING — THEY BECOME ISOLATED AFRAID TO VENTURE FORTH TO SHOP ATTEND RELIGIOUS SERVICES JOIN FRIENDS AT SENIOR CENTERS OR EVEN PICK UP THEIR KAIL FROM CRACK INFESTED BUILDING LOBBIES BECOME PRISONERS IN THEIR HOMES TO ADDRESS THIS URGENT PROBLEM A NUMBER OF STEPS MUST BE TAKEN FIRST STATES MUST BE GIVEN MASSIVE NEW RESOURCES FOR LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT EFFORTS DRUG TREATMENT EDUCATION AND PREVENTION AND SERVICES FOR DRUG ABUSERS AND THEIR VICTIMS ALTHOUGH BOTH THE PRESIDENT AND CONGRESS HAVE BEEN AWARE THE ENORMITY OF AMERICA S DRUG CRISIS AND PROCLAIMED A WAR THEY HAVE NOT FUNDED ONE AS RECENTLY SEPTEMBER PRESIDENT BUSH IN WHAT WAS SUPPOSED TO BE A MAJOR DRUG INITIATIVE PROPOSED ONLY A BILLION INCREASE FOR ALL ANTI DRUG ACTIVITIES IN THE COUNTRY THIS GROSSLY INADEQUATE WHAT S WORSE THE LARGEST SINGLE EXPENDITURE IN THAT BILLION INCREASE WOULD BE FOR FEDERAL PRISONS AN ITEM WHICH DOES NOT ADDRESS ANY THE GRAVELY SERIOUS PROBLEMS DISCUSSED THE PRESIDENT WAS SHARPLY AND TO HY HIND CORRECTLY CRITICIZED TOR THIS SHORT SIGHTED PROPOSAL KIND OF HONEY COULDN T WIN AN ARGUMENT LET ALONE A WAR CONGRESS IS GOING TO INCREASE THE FUNDING PROPOSED BY THE PRESIDENT SUBSTANTIALLY CONGRESS MUST REALIZE A SERIOUS COMMITMENT TO THE DRUG WAR WILL REQUIRE AN EQUALLY SERIOUS COMMITMENT OF RESOURCES HOPE WE WOULD NOT SEE THE SAME THING HAPPEN THIS HAPPENED IN WHEN CONGRESS AUTHORIZED BILLION IN THE ANTI DRUG ACT AND THEN ONLY APPROPRIATED BILLION FOR TOO LONG THE MONEY HAVE RECEIVED HAS BEEN FAR TOO LITTLE AND HAS COME FAR TOO BY TIME RECEIVE ANTI DRUG PROBLEM HAS GROWN MUCH WORSE FOR EXAMPLE NEW YORK STATE IS ONLY NOW RECEIVING SOME THE FUNDS AUTHORIZED IN FOR DRUG TREATMENT AND CAN NOW ONLY BEGIN TO CONTRACT THE THE MONEY WILL FUND THESE NOT ACTUALLY BE AVAILABLE FOR THOSE WHO THEM FOR MONTHS AT BEST IN THE MEANTIME WAITING LISTS CONTINUE TO GROW CONGRESS MUST ENSURE THE MONEY IT APPROPRIATES IS SUFFICIENT TO DO THE JOB AND IT REACHES THOSE IN NEED PROMPTLY WARS MUST BE FOUGHT QUICKLY AND DECISIVELY THIS A WAR AMERICA CANNOT AFFORD TO LOSE SECOND WE DEMAND SIDE WITH TREATMENT EDUCATION AND PREVENTION THIS COUNTRY MUST HAVE AN EFFECTIVE POLICY TO REDUCE THE SUPPLY OF DRUGS THAT ENTER THIS COUNTRY THE REAGAN ADMINISTRATION TO DEVELOP SUCH POLICY THE BUSH ADMINISTRATION HAS DONE NO BETTER THE BUSH ADMINISTRATION MILLION DOLLARS JN MILITARY AID TO BOLIVIA PERU AND COLOMBIA THE ADMINISTRATION HAS COME UP WITH NO COMPREHENSIVE PLAN FOR SPENDING THIS MONEY IN A WAY THAT WILL HELP REDUCE THE GROWING OF COCA OR THE PRODUCTION OF COCAINE SIMILARLY ALTHOUGH LAST YEAR S OMNIBUS DRUG LEGISLATION MANDATED THE SECRETARY OF STATE PREPARE A REPORT BY MAY EXAMINING THE FEASIBILITY OF CREATING A MULTI NATIONAL COMPREHENSIVE STRATEGY AGAINST COCA TRAFFICKERS THE REPORT HAS STILL NOT BEEN SUBMITTED AT LEAST A HAL ^ r DOZEN OTHER REPORTS REQUIRED OTHER AGENCIES IN THE EXECUTIVE BRANCH AND INTENDED TO GIVE CONGRESS INFORMATION ABOUT HOW MUCH MONEY IS NEEDED FOR VARIOUS ANTI DRUG INITIATIVES AND HOW BEST TO SPEND THE MONEY EFFECTIVELY ARE ALSO SIX MONTHS OVERDUE THE EXECUTIVE BRANCH MUST LIVE UP TO ITS RESPONSIBILITIES AND WHEN NECESSARY CONGRESS MUST MAKE IT DO SO THIRD STATES MUST BE GIVEN STRONGER WEAPONS TO FIGHT DRUG TRAFFICKING FEDERAL GOVERNMENT HAS STRONG FORFEITURE LAWS WHICH ALLOW FEDERAL PROSECUTORS TO CLOSE DOWN DRUG DENS AND SEIZE THE VAST REAL PROPERTY HOLDINGS OF DRUG DEALERS MANY SUCH NEW YORK DO NOT ALLOW THE SEIZURE OF REAL PROPERTY USED IN THE DRUG TRADE THIS FORCES US TO RELY ON SLOW AND CUMBERSOME LOCAL NUISANCE LAWS TO EVICT DRUG WHO TAKEN OVER BUILDINGS OR APARTMENTS TO USE DRUG MARKETS FACTORIES OR WAREHOUSES BEEN WORXING ALONG WITH NEW YORK S LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES TO STRENGHTHEN NEW YORK STATE S LAW IN THE MEANTIME PROSECUTORS ARE OFTEN FORCED TO TURN TO THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT FOR HELP BECAUSE OF THEIR STRONGER LAWS PROVISIONS IN RECENT FEDERAL LEGISLATION WHICH LIMIT STATES ABILITY TO USE THERE ARE SEVERAL AREAS IN WHICH INCREASED FEDERAL FUNDING TO THE STATES COULD BE ENORMOUSLY HELPFUL MY OFFICE AND OTHERS IN NEW YORK STATE HAVE ESTABLISHED NARCOTICS EVICTION PROGRAMS TO ASSIST LANDLORDS IN EVICTING DRUG FROM THEIR APARTMENTS WE THESE PROGRAMS TO BE VERY SUCCESSFUL IN LESS THAN A YEAR ALMOST DRUG IN KINGS COUNTY HAVE BEEN EVICTED SUCH PROGRAMS GO FAR TO RETURN NEIGHBORHOODS TO COMMUNITY MEMBERS AND LOWER CRIME RATES FEDERAL SUPPORT TO EXPAND THESE PROGRAMS IS NEEDED RESOURCES ARE ALSO DESPERATELY NEEDED TO PROVIDE DRUG TREATMENT AT LEAST TO THOSE WHO DESIRE IT NUMBER OF PEOPLE ADDICTED TO DRUGS CAN ONLY A POSITIVE EFtECT ON OUR CRIME PATE YET NEW YORK AND OTHER STATES CONTINUE TO TURN PEOPLE AWAY WHO SEEK TREATMENT THESE DO NOT HAVE ENOUGH SPACE IN TREATMENT PROGRAMS ACCORDING TO THE NEW YORK STATE DIVISION OF SUBSTANCE ABUSE SERVICES IN WERE AN ESTIMATED MILLION ADULTS AND MINORS IN NEW YORK STATE WHO USED COCAINE YET IN DESPITE THE ENORMOUS NEED ARE ONLY DRUG FREE RESIDENTIAL TREATMENT BEDS AVAILABLE THE DRUG FREE RESIDENTIAL FACILITIES ARE OPERATING AT OF CAPACITY AND HAVE A WAITING LIST OF OVER FEDERAL GOVERNMENT HAS RECENTLY SIGNIFICANT CONTRIBUTION TO NEW YORK STATE TO REDUCE THESE WAITING LISTS MENTIONED ABOVE MUCH MUCH MORE IS NEEDED IT NEEDS TO REACH THE MUCH MORE QUICKLY NEW YORK STATE HAS BEEN MAKING EFFORTS TO INCREASE THE STATE RESOURCES AVAILABLE FOR DRUG TREATMENT BOTH THROUGH EFFORTS TO STRENGHTHEN ITS FORFEITURE LAW THROUGH RECENT LEGISLATION WHICH INCREASED DRUG PINES AND DIRECTED THE HONEY COLLECTED BE USED FOR DRUG TREATMENT PLEASED TO NOTE THAT MY OFFICE HAD FIRST PROPOSED THE CONCEPT OF RAISING DRUG FINES IN THIRD AND FINAL EFFECT OF CRACK ON THE ELDERLY THAT LIKE TO DISCUSS TODAY THE FACT IT HAS CAUSED GRANDPARENTS TO ASSUME CARE OF CHILDREN ABANDONED OR ABUSED BY CRACK ADDICTED PARENTS SURVEY BY THE NEW YORK STATE DIVISION OF SUBSTANCE ABUSE SERVICES ESTIMATED THAT OF NEW YORK STATE S CHILDREN HAVE PARENTS WHO ARE SUBSTANCE ABUSERS THE CRACK ADDICTION THESE PARENTS HAS HAD DISASTROUS RESULTS FOR THEIR CHILDREN IN « THE DEATHS OF CHILDREN KILLED BY ABUSE OR NEGLECT RESULTED FROM PARENTAL DRUG ABUSE UP FROM % IN TO NUMBER OF BABIES BORN IN NEW YORK CITY WITH DRUGS IN THEIR URINE MORE THAN TRIPLED FROM TO THESE BABIES TESTED POSITIVE FOR COCAINE THIS NOT A PHENOMENON RESTRICTED TO NEW YORK IN STUDY CONDUCTED AT HOSPITALS THE COUNTRY REPORTEDLY % OF WOMEN IN THE HOSPITALS STUDIED HAD USED ILLEGAL DRUGS IN PREGNANCY THE DATA SUGGESTED THAT AS MANY BABIES IN THIS COUNTRY FACED POSSIBLE HEALTH PROBLEMS A RESULT MANY THESE BABIES BE THE CARE OF THEIR PARENTS BY COURT ORDER IN NEW YORK CITY THE NUMBER OF SO CALLED « BOARDER BABIES " — BABIES WHO BEEN REMOVED FROM THEIR PARENTS AT BIRTH AND ARE AWAITING PLACEMENT IN FOSTER CARE — HAS INCREASED FROM A MONTH IN FEBRUARY TO A MONTH OF NOVEMBER THESE BABIES HAVE TESTED POSITIVE FOR DRUGS THESE BABIES MAY FACE SERIOUS HEALTH PROBLEMS A RESULT THEIR PARENT S USE OF DRUGS INCLUDING SEIZURES SEVERE RESPIRATORY PROBLEMS CONGENITAL INFECTIONS AND WITHDRAWAL SYMPTOMS AN INCREASING NUMBER SUFFER FROM CONGENITAL SYPHILIS AND AIDS SOME MAY FACE LONG TERM ILLNESS OR DISABILITY MANY AS BABIES AND LATER AS CHILDREN MAY ALSO HAVE GRAVE PSYCHOLOGICAL OR EMOTIONAL PROBLEMS THESE PHYSICAL AND PSYCHOLOGICAL PROBLEMS MAY MAKE THESE BABIES MORE DIFFICULT TO PLACE WITH FOSTER FAMILIES OTHER CHILDREN DRUG ADDICTED PARENTS MAY BE GIVEN OVER VOLUNTARILY TO RELATIVES FOR CARE GRANDPARENTS ARE INCREASINGLY FORCED TO BECOME PARENTS AGAIN WHEN THEIR OWN CHILDREN TURN TO DRUGS TAKING SUCH RESPONSIBILITY OBVIOUSLY HAS SERIOUS CONSEQUENCES FOR THE GRANDPARENTS WHO MAY LACK THE PHYSICAL STRENGTH OR FINANCIAL TO CARRY THEIR NEW BURDEN IN ADDITION RESULT OF ABUSE BY OR THE ADDICTION OF THEIR PARENTS THESE CHILDREN MAY COME WITH SERIOUS PHYSICAL AND EMOTIONAL PROBLEMS SITUATION IS ONLY GOING TO GET WORSE RECENT HAVE SHOWN THAT WOMEN ARE BECOMING INCREASINGLY ADDICTED TO CRACK THE DRUG ENFORCEMENT ADMINISTRATION ESTIMATED % OF CRACK USERS ON THE STREET ARE WOMEN BOTH MALE AND FEMALE ADDICTS HAVE ABANDONED AND ABUSED THEIR CHILDREN DRUG ABUSE BY MOTHERS COULD A GREATER IMPACT ON THE FAMILY ESPECIALLY WHERE THE MOTHER THE ONLY PARENT CARING THE FAMILY THIS COULD HAVE A PARTICULAR IMPACT ON MINORITY FAMILIES BECAUSE THE HIGH CLEARLY THERE AN URGENT NEED TO ADDRESS THE PROBLEM OP DRUG ADDICTED PARENTS AND TO DEVISE WAYS PROTECTING THEIR CHILDREN AND SPARING THEIR GRANDPARENTS THERE MUST BE RESEARCH ON THE PHYSICAL PROBLEMS LIKELY TO BE FACED BY CRACK BABIES STEPS MUST BE TAKEN TO ENSURE THERE ARE ADEQUATE PLACEMENT OPTIONS FOR BABIES WITH SPECIAL NEEDS SPECIAL COUNSELING AND NEEDED MEDICAL SERVICES MUST BE AVAILABLE TO THESE CHILDREN AND DRUG TREATMENT PROGRAMS FOR THEIR PARENTS IN ADDITION THERE AN URGENT NEED FOR EDUCATIONAL PROGRAMS AND SERVICES FOR PREGNANT DRUG ABUSING WOMEN WE CAN BEGIN TO CONTAIN THE NUMBER OF DRUG ADDICTED INFANTS FINALLY WHERE PREVENTION FAILS THERE NEED TO ASSIST GRANDPARENTS WITH HEALTH CARE SUPPORT SERVICES AND FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE SO THEY CAN PROVIDE THEIR NEW CHARGES WITH A SAFE AND HEALTHY ENVIRONMENT ALL THESE PROGRAMS WOULD HAVE TO BE COORDINATED IN A MULTI DISCIPLINARY EFFORT TO AFFORD GREATER CHANCE FOR SUCCESS THE ELDERLY HAVE BEEN TERRIBLY AFFECTED BY CRACK PHYSICALLY EMOTIONALLY AND SOCIALLY THEY AT INCREASED RISK OF PHYSICAL HARM FROM BOTH FAMILY AND STRANGERS AND ARE INCREASINGLY FEARFUL AND ISOLATED IN DANGEROUS COMMUNITIES NONETHELESS IT IS THEY WHO ARE BEING ASKED TO ASSUME GREATER RESPONSIBILITY FOR MANY CHILDREN IT IS IMPORTANT THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT TO COME TO THE ASSISTANCE THE ELDERLY IN THE WAYS SO THEY CAN LOOK FORWARD TO A SAFER AND MORE SECURE FUTURE THAN AWAITS THEM NOW Chairman Ms Holtzman thank statement Senator Heinz STATEMENT OF SENATOR JOHN HEINZ

DEPUTY DIRECTOR F9k PLANNING AND DEVELOPMENT CENTRAL ARKANSAS AREA AGENCY ON AGING NOVEMBER IS MR CHAIRMAN MEM8ERS THE COMMITTEE YOUR INVITATION TO HEAR TESTIMONY ON BEHALF THE ELDERLY IN CENTRAL ARKANSAS IS APPRECIATED THE ROUTINE OF EVERY OAY PROBLEMS ACTIVITIES AND IMMEDIATE DETAILS TO BE AODRESSED IN OUR AGENCY SOMETIMES MAKES IT DIFFICULT TO MAINTAIN A PERSPECTIVE CHANGES WITHOUT REALLY REALIZING THEY HAVE OCCUREO WE WERE INVITED TO TESTIFY BEFORE THIS COMMITTEE NOT MUCH THOUGHT WAS GIVEN TO THE EFFECTS OF ILLEGAL DRUGS ON THE AGENCY JUST EFFECTS IN THE COMMITTEE STAFF BRIEFING FOUR QUESTIONS WERE ASKED LIKE TO STRUCTURE MY COMMENTS THESE QUESTIONS WE CHANGED THE WAY WE DELIVER SERVICES A RESULT OF ILLEGAL DRUGS THREE TO YEARS AGO VOLUNTEERS WERE USED FREQUENTLY TO DELIVERY IN HOME IDEALS NO MORE NOW IN SOME AREAS WHERE OVERT DRUG ACTIVITY IS PREVALENT WE TO SENP PAID STAFF IN SOME INSTANCES TWO PAID STAFF MEMBERS GO FOR SECURITY REASONS WE HAVE HAD TO MOVE SOME SERVICE LOCATIONS AND STOP MAKING ^ REFERRALS TO SOME SERVICE PROVIDERS WE SEVERE PROBLEMS FINDING PERSONAL CARE AIDES TO WORK IN SOME SECTIONS THE GREATER LITTLE ROCK AREA SOME AIDES REFUSE TO WORK AND THE CLIENTS ARE NOT BEING SERVED TRANSPORTATION ROUTES HAVE BEEN ALTERED WHICH CREATES HARDSHIPS AND ADDS TO THE ISOLATION OUR CLIENTS A SPECIFIC INCIDENCE OUR CHANGING SERVICE PATTERNS IS DIRECTLY RELATED TO OUR FREE STANDING HOSPICE PROGRAM WE WERE OFFERED FREE OFFICE SPACE TO HOUSE OUR HOSPICE STAFF BUT BECAUSE THE LOCATION WE REFUSED TO ACCEPT THE OFFER WHY SPACE WAS LOCATED ADJACENT TO A PUBLIC HOUSING PROJECT WHERE OVERT DRUG ACTIVITY DAILY OCCURENCE WITHIN OUR HOSPICE PROGRAM NURSES ARE ON CALL HOURS DAY SERVICES REQUIRE THAT CONTROLLED DRUGS BE TRANSPORTED TO PATIENTS AT ALL HOURS WE IT WAS SIMPLY TOO DANGEROUS TO STORE DRUGS THIS CLOSE TO ILLEGAL DRUG ACTIVITIES WE FELT WE WERE ONLY ASKING FOR TROUBLE IN ANOTHER INSTANCE OF OUR CONTRACT AGENCIES LOCATED NEAR A PUBLIC HOUSING PROJECT REPORTED ILLEGAL DRUG ACTIVITIES OUTSIDE THEIR OFFICE TWO MEN THE BUILOING AND MADE THREATS TO THE STAFF AND WARNED THEM TO STOP CALLING THE POLICE OR " WE WILL MESS YOU UP THESE A FEW THE EXPERIENCES WE HAVE HAD CONCERNING THE QUESTION OF SERVICE DELIVERY CHANGES THE SECOND QUESTION HOW ELDERLY THEMSELVES AFFECTED BY DRUGS LOSS OF FREEDOM TO WALK THE STREETS SAFELY ISOLATION FEAR OF RETALIATION IF THEY REPORT DRUG ACTIVITY IN SOME CASES WE HAVE HAD CLIENTS REFUSE TO ANSWER THE DOOR TO RECEIVE HOME DELIVERED MEALS AND CASE MANAGEMENT VISITS THEY SIMPLY SIT AND LOOK OUT THE WINDOW AND NOT ANSWER THE DOOR WE H ^ D REPORTS SOME CLIENTS ARE SUBJECT TO ABUSE BY FAMILY MEMBERS AND SOCIAL SECURITY CHECKS ARE USED TO SUPPORT DRUG HABITS OK OTHER MEMBERS THE FAMILY IN SUMMARY IT
