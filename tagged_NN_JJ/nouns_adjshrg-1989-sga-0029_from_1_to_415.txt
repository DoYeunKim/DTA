MORE SPECIFICALLY KILL TO MAINTAIN A WAY OF LIFE THAT DRUG SALES ALLOWED IN SIMPLE TERMS THE SHEER NUMBER OF INMATES IMPACTED BY THIS BILLION FUNDING PACKAGE A SMALL PERCENTAGE OF THOSE WHO TO BE

LOOKING AIRCRAFT AT AIRPORTS THE STATE AND RECOGNIZING ACTIVITIES THAT MIGHT INDICATE DRUG TRAFFICKING IT WAS UNDERSTOOD RIGHT FROM THE BEGINNING THAT OUR SOLDIERS AND AIRMEN WOULD NOT ENGAGE IN LAW ENFORCEMENT THEY NOT BE ALLOWED TO ARREST OR DETAIN SUSPECTS THEY WOULD NQI KNOWINGLY BE PLACED IN A HOSTILE OR DANGEROUS ENVIRONMENT HOWEVER THEY WOULD REPORT ALL SUSPICIOUS ACTIVITIES TO THE GBI WHO WOULD IN TURN TAKE SUCH ACTIONS THE DEEMED APPROPRIATE AND THE NATIONAL GUARD TERRITORIES WITH GEORGIA A LEADING EXAMPLE BECOME MORE INVOLVED IN SUPPORT OF LAW ENFORCEMENT SUPPORT WAS PROVIDED DURING STATE ACTIVE DUTY MISSIONS AND IN AN INDIVIDUAL OR UNIT TRAINING STATUS PAID FOR BYTHE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT BUT UNDER THE CONTROL AND SUBJECT TO THE LAWS THE RESPECTIVE THIS COMBINING TRAINING SUPPORT

********************** *********************** DRUG RELATED CRIME AND DEATHS IN OUR NATION S CAPITOL AND ON THE STREETS OF MAJOR CITIES THE COUNTRY HAVE ELICITED CRIES TO " CALL OUT THE NATIONAL GUARD THOSE PROPONENTS THE CALLING OUT THE GUARD TO ENVISION GUARD MEMBERS CORDONING OFF AREAS THE CITIES ARRESTING DRUG TRAFFICKERS SECURING NEIGHBORHOODS ENFORCING LAWS AND MEETING THE DRUG TRAFFICKER EYE BALL TO EYE BALL HEAD ON ON THE CITY STREETS THESE PROPOSALS HAVE EVOKED LOUD CRIES OF SUPPORT FROM SOME QUARTERS AND LOUDER VOCAL OPPOSITION FROM OTHERS ARE AT LEAST TWO ASPECTS TO THE PROPOSALS FIRST COULD THE NATIONAL GUARD PERFORM SUCH A MISSION SECONDLY SHOULD THE NATIONAL GUARD BE DIRECTED TO EXECUTE SUCH A MISSION TO ANSWER THE FIRST YES THE GUARD COULD DO IT A MILITARY UNIT IS CAPABLE ACCOMPLISHING THESE TASKS MILITARYf ASHION UND ER MILITABY BUIES QUESTION OF SHOULD THE NATIONAL GUARD BE DIRECTED TO TAKE TO THE STREETS TO EXECUTE THE PROPOSED MISSIONS DOES NOT OFFER NEARLY AS CLEAR AN ISSUE NOR AS SIMPLE ANSWER A THE FIRST ISSUE TO RESOLVE IS OBJECTIVE HOW CAN ATTAINMENT BE MEASURED AND THE OBJECTIVE ACHIEVABLE * r NORMALLY CALLING THE GUARD WOULD BE CONSIDERED A SHOCK TREATMENT A SURGE OP MANPOWER AND EQUIPMENT TO ACHIEVE A SPECIFIC GOAL RESTORE PEACE CLEAR THE SNOW TAKE THE FACILITY PREVENT LOOTING EVACUATE THE INJURED AND AID THE ENDANGERED THE GUARD IS CALLED WHEN THERE ARE IMMEDIATE LIFE THREATENING CIRCUMSTANCES CAPABILITY OF LOCAL AUTHORITIES THE CALL HAS NEVER BEEN A LONG TERM SOLUTION BUT RATHER A TEMPORARY ACTIVITY DESIGNED TO OVERCOME AN IMMEDIATE AND GRAVE PROBLEM THUS THE ESTABLISHMENT A CLEAR OBJECTIVE IS PARAMOUNT WHAT EXACTLY WE WANT TO ACCOMPUSH IN THIS WAR WE ARE WAGING THE ANSWER IS SIMPLE ENOUGH STOP_DRUGSIII BUT LETS EXAMINE THE ISSUE MILITARY OBJECTIVES ARE RELATIVELY SIMPLE HILL *********************** pause ***««»****»«**«****«* IN MILITARY TERMS OBJECTIVES ARE ABLE TO BE EXECUTED MEASURED AND EVALUATED TIME THE MEASURE IS SUCCESS OR FAILURE NO MIDDLE GROUND MILITARY IS TRAINED EQUIPPED AND MANNED TO WIN OR LOSE IN SIMPLE BLACK AND WHITE TERMS NO GRAY AREAS " STOP DRUGS * PRESENTS A LESS CLEAR OBJECTIVE AND AN ENVIRONMENT THAT DEALS IN MANY " GRAY * AREAS WE WOULD ALL LIKE A BLACK AND WHITE VICTORY IN THE WAR ON DRUGS BUT WE MUST DECIDE WHAT CONSTITUTES VICTORY AND AT WHAT PRICE THE GUARD COULD CORDON OFF AN AREA A CITY BUT IF WE RE NOT GOING TO TOTALLY CUT OFF ACCESS TO THE OUTSIDE AREAS WHAT DO WE ACCOMPLISH GRAY AREA WE THE GUARD TO CONTROL OUR ACCESS TO CERTAIN NEIGHBORHOODS WE THE ARMED SOLDIERS CONFRONTING US ON STREET CORNERS WE WANT THE MILITARY OR THE POLICE SEARCHING US WE ENTER AND EXIT CERTAIN NEIGHBORHOODS ARE WE PREPARED TO ACCEPT A CURFEW ON OUR PERSONAL ACTIVITIES ft * DO WE LIMIT IT ONLY TO CERTAIN NEIGHBORHOODS ARE THERE CONSTITUTIONAL ISSUES INVOLVED DECLARATION OF MARTIAL LAW REQUIRED OR LEGAL THESE ARE ALL GRAY AREAS POUCE POWER IS RESERVED TO CIVILIAN GOVERNMENT IN OUR COUNTRY ARE WE PREPARED TO EMPOWER THE MILITARY TO MAKE ARRESTS OF CIVILIANS IN OUR COUNTRY DOES GIVING POUCE POWERS TO SOLDIERS GO BEYOND THE ISSUE OF DRUG ENFORCEMENT ARE SUCH ARRESTS MADE UNDER MARTIAL LAW OR CIVIL LAW INDEMNIFY THE ACTIONS THE SOLDIER ON THE STREET SOLDIERS RIGHTS MARTIAL LAW WE SEEN IN THIRD WORLD COUNTRIES CAN BE A VERY POTENT MOTIVATOR CONVERSELY WE SEEN IT EVOKE EVEN MORE VIOLENT REACTION FROM THOSE WHO LOST CERTAIN FREEDOMS GOOD EXAMPLE TODAY IS PALESTINE ARE WE PREPARED TO CHANGE OUR DAY TO DAY LIVES TO ACCOMMODATE A CERTAIN KIND OF MARTIAL LAW AS IS BEING DISCUSSED ARE WE PREPARED TO FOREGO CERTAIN CIVIL LIBERTIES ARE WE PREPARED TO ALLOW THE MILITARY TO HAVE THESE THE STREETS OF ALL THE CITIES OF ALL THE OR ASSUMPTION THE TROOPS WILL ONLY BE ON THE STREETS THE OTHER PERSON ’ S NEIGHBORHOOD PRICE OF CALLING OUT THE GUARD OUR PLANNING FIGURE IS PER DAY PER SOLDIER OR AIRMAN ON STATE ACTIVE DUTY THIS COVERS SALARY FOOD EQUIPMENT ETC ARE WE PREPARED TO TELL EMPLOYERS OF GUARD MEMBERS THAT THEIR ON DUTY AND THEY ’ LL NOT RETURN UNTIL THE WAR ON DRUGS IS WON WE TELL THE SOLDIER WHO WAS MAKING FIVE TO TIMES HIS GUARD SALARY IN THE CIVILIAN JOB MARKET HE TELL HIS CREDITORS IN TIME OF WAR THIS ALL PROVIDED FOR IN THE SOLDIERS AND SAILORS RELIEF ACT ). TYPICALLY THE GUARD IS CALLED OUT A FEW DAYS IN TIME OF GREAT EMERGENCY IT IS NOT A SUBSTITUTE FOR THE LOCAL AUTHORITIES BUT RATHER AUGMENTATION IN TIME OF GREAT NEED HOW MUCH TIME IT TAKE TO WIN THE WAR ON DRUGS AND WHAT CONSTITUTES VICTORY FOR THIS PURPOSE THE GEORGIA GUARD HAS BEEN A FULL CONTRIBUTING MEMBER OF GOVERNOR HARRIS ’ TASK FORCE A NUMBER OF YEARS WE HAVE PLAYED AN IMPORTANT PART IN THE IDENTIFICATION AND SUBSEQUENT SEIZURE OF SIGNIFICANT QUANTITIES OF DRUGS LIKE TO CITE TWO EXAMPLES ON ONE OCCASION OF OUR AIR GUARD RADAR UNITS WORKING IN THE FLORIDA PANHANDLE WITH THE GBI FLORIDA LAW ENFORCEMENT THE U S CUSTOMS THE DRUG ENFORCEMENT ADMINISTRATION LOCKED ONTO AN AIRPLANE COMING NORTH FROM THE GULF OF MEXICO THEY CHASE PLANE THAT AIRCRAFT TO AN AIRFIELD IN WEST VIRGINIA THE PILOT THE DRUG AIRCRAFT WAS FRANTICALLY THROWING OUT BALES OF MARIJUANA ALL THE WAY TIME THE CHASE PLANE LANDED THE DRUG PILOT WAS GONE AUTHORITIES ABOUT POUNDS OF MARIJUANA STILL ON BOARD THE PILOT HAD LEFT IN A HURRY AND IN HIS HASTE LEFT HIS WALLET COMPLETE WITH DRIVERS LICENSE ON THE SEAT HE WAS APPREHENDED IN WITH FEDERAL AUTHORITIES IN SOUTH FLORIDA OF OUR ARMY AIR CREWS SIGHTED A PANAMANIAN FREIGHTER THE CREW VECTORED A COAST GUARD CUTTER TO INTERCEPT THE COAST GUARD WAS ABLE THEN TO SEIZE THE SHIP AND ITS CARGO OF MARIJUANA WITH A STREET VALUE OF MILLION WE ARE VERY CAREFUL WE DO NOT PUBLICLY IDENTIFY UNITS OR INDIVIDUALS TAKING PART IN THESE MISSIONS TO DO SO WOULD VERY POSSIBLY JEOPARDIZE THEM PLAY HARD BALL WE ARE VERY ACTIVE IN THE PROGRAM AND HAVE EVERY INTENTION KEEPING ACTIVE AND EVEN INCREASING OUR ROLE BUT THE LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES AND ALL THE MILITARY FORCES COMBINED CANNOT STOP THE FLOW OF DRUGS INTO THIS COUNTRY AS LONG THERE DEMAND THEM LONG THE POTENTIAL IS SO GREAT FOR THOSE WILLING TO RISK A SHORT JAIL TERM DEATH TO MAKE MILLIONS THE THREAT WILL STAY WITH US LAW ENFORCEMENT PEOPLE AND YOUR NATIONAL GUARD ARE DOING WHAT THEY CAN BUT TO WIN IT MEANS ALL OF US MUST SERIOUSLY JOIN IN THIS WAR RHETORIC WONT WIN IT BUT A UNITED AND DETERMINED CITIZENRY SUPPORTING THEIR ELECTED LAW MAKERS EFFECTIVE LAWS EFFECTIVE COURT SYSTEMS HARSH PENALTIES
