RESCUE THE AMERICAN PEOPLE FROM THE TERROR OF DRUGS AND VIOLENCE CONGRESS POWER TO GIVE THE AMERICAN PEOPLE A REASON TO HOPE CONVINCED THE DRUG EPIDEMIC — AT ITS ROOTS — IS CAUSED BY A PROFOUND SENSE OF HOPELESSNESS LAST THING THE AMERICAN PEOPLE NEED DRUG STRATEGY THAT INCREASES — RATHER THAN REDUCES — THAT HOPELESSNESS THAT WHY CONCERNED THE PRESIDENT PROPOSES TO FUND THE ANTI DRUG PACKAGE BY CUTTING JUVENILE JUSTICE PROGRAMS HOUSING PROGRAMS AND PROGRAMS TARGETED TO OUR NATIONS MOST RECENT IMMIGRANTS IT SEEMS TO ME WE ARE SENDING THE WRONG MESSAGE IT SEEMS TO ME WE WILL CAUSE THC SAME PEOPLE THAT ARE THESE VERY PROGRAMS TO ESCAPE PROM DRUGS TO LOSE THEIR LAST LITTLE BIT OP BOPE THAT WHY CONCERNED WHEN THE SENATE PROPOSES TO CUT DOMESTIC PROGRAMS ACROSS THE BOARD IN THE NAME OP PUNDING THE ANTI DRUG PROGRAM IT SEEMS THE SENATE DOES NOT UNDERSTAND THE BACK TO SCHOOL PROGRAMS THE JOB TRAINING PROGRAMS THE HEALTH CARE PROGRAMS THE HOUSING PROGRAMS AND ALL OP THE PEDERALLY PUNDED PROGRAMS ARE ALL PART THE ANTI DRUG EFFORT IF PEOPLE LOSE THESE PROGRAMS PEOPLE WILL LOSE HOPE THAT WHY CONCERNED THE PRESIDENT TALKS ABOUT SUPPORTING LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT EFFORTS — YET LAST THE AMOUNT OF MONEY RECEIVED BY THE CITY OF BOSTON FROM THE FEDERAL LAW ENFORCEMENT GRANT WAS A MERE THAN PAY THE PAPERWORK IN OUR DRUG UNIT IT PALES IN COMPARISON TO THE NEARLY MILLION PER MONTH THE

PROBLEM — AND THEY BOTH TELL ME " TREATMENT ON DEMAND " — WITHOUT HESITATING FOR A MINUTE THEY ARE SO CLEAR THE SOLUTIONS ARE — BUT WE DO NOT ALWAYS LISTEN TO THOSE WHO BEEN THERE AND HAVE MADE IT BACK CONCERNED ADMINISTRATION S FUNDING COMPROMISE WITH THE SENATE CALLS A % CUT ACROSS THE BOARD CUT IN FEDERAL PROGRAMS ALTHOUGH FINAL DETAILS HAVE NOT YET BEEN WORKED OUT IT IS IMPORTANT TO LOOK AT THOSE POTENTIAL CUTS IN A VERY REAL WAY IN FOUR PROGRAMS ALONE — DEALING WITH EDUCATION PUBLIC HOUSING JOB TRAINING AND COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT BLOCK GRANTS FUNDS THE CITY OF BOSTON COULD LOSE WITHOUT COMMITMENT TO DIRECT FUNDING FROM THESE NEW ANTI DRUG PROGRAMS THERE NO GUARANTEE BOSTON WON T END UP LOSING FEDERAL DOLLARS IN THE NAME OF FIGHTING DRUGS IT COSTS A CITY THREE MILLION DOLLARS — OR THREE HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS — OR THREE THOUSAND DOLLARS IT SIMPLY DOES NOT MAKE SENSE TO CUT PROGRAMS WHICH OFFER REAL HOPE AND OPPORTUNITY AND DO IT IN THE NAME OF FIGHTING A REAL WAR ON DRUGS HERE IN BOSTON WE HAVE MADE THE TOUGH CHOICES FOUND THE RESOURCES ESTABLISHED PRIORITIES AND RELIED ON THE CREATIVE ENERGY AND COMMITMENT THE COMMUNITY TO ADDRESS THE DRUG PROBLEM AND WE LOOK FOR NO LESS THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT Ill AGAIN LET HE EMPHASIZE THAT THOSE OF US IN AMERICA S CITIES ARE LOOKING TO CONGRESS TO HOLD THE ADMINISTRATION ACCOUNTABLE FOR ITS PROMISES WE ARE ASKING CONGRESS NOT TO APPROVE A PROGRAM — UNLESS YOU PLAN TO FUND IT HERE AT THE LOCAL LEVEL — HERE IN A PLACE LIKE THE ROXBURY BOYS AND GIRLS CLUB THE PEOPLE ON THE FRONT LINES KNOW THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN TALK AND ACTION — BETWEEN PROMISES AND COMMITMENT HERE — IN AMERICA S CITIES — WE BELIEVE THE AMERICAN PEOPLE ARE SICK OF DRUGS AND TIRED OF TALK WE THEY SUPPORT A WHOLE HEARTED COMMITMENT TO SOLVE THE PROBLEM OF DRUGS YESTERDAY THE SENATE ADOPTED AN AMENDMENT THAT WOULD EXTEND MEDICAID BENEFITS TO PEOPLE SEEKING TREATMENT FOR DRUG ABUSE IF THEY CANNOT AFFORD TO PAY THESE THE KIND OF MEASURES CONGRESS MUST SUPPORT — AND THE AMERICAN PEOPLE WILL SUPPORT IN CLOSING TO SAY THAT CHAIRMAN RANGEL S BELIEF THE AMERICAN PEOPLE ARE WILLING TO FIND THE RESOURCES AND BEAR THE COST TO END THIS EPIDEMIC OF DRUGS
