THE REST THE POPULATION know many public housing SOHEWHAT ISOLATED FROM THE LARGER COMMUNITY INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO ITS LAW ENFORCEMENT THIS ISOLATION MAKES PUBLIC HOUSING AN ATTRACTIVE LOCATION FOR AN ILLEGAL ACTIVITY Public housing federal CREATED UNDER STATE LAW ARE USUALLY SEPARATE MUNICIPAL housing COMMONLY APPOINTED BY THE MAYOR OR COUNTY EXECUTIVE OR A COMBINATION THE EXECUTIVE AND THE LOCAL LEGISLATIVE BODY THE EMPLOYEES THE HOUSING AUTHORITY ARE EMPLOYEES THAT CORPORATION AND NOT FEDERAL EMPLOYEES HUO CONTRACTUAL RELATIONSHIP WITH PUBLIC HOUSING AUTHORITIES AND PROVIDES FUNDING FOR CONSTRUCTION OF THEIR PROPERTIES OPERATING SUBSIDIES AND FOR MODERNIZATION OF THEIR PROPERTIES IN RETURN THE FUNDING AUTHORITIES ARE TO PROVIDE DECENT SAFE ANP SANITARY HOUSING THE LOCAL LOW INCOME POPULATION DECENT SAFE AND SANITARY HOUSING IS OBVIOUSLY NOT POSSIBLE WHERE DRUG ACTIVITY CONTROLLING INFLUENCE HUD S PARTICIPATION IN THE PARTNERSHIP THEN PROCEEDED FROM TWO SEEMINGLY CONFLICTING PREMISES • Public housing SOLUTION TO THE DRUG PROBLEM WOULD HAVE TO BE DESIRED AND DEVELOPED LOCALLY • Federal Government contractual right ENORMOUS FINANCIAL STAKE IN SEEING THE FEDERAL

MANAGERS RESIDENT LEADERS LAU ENFORCEMENT OFFICIALS FROM ALL LEVELS THE HEDIA AND LEADERS FROM THE PRIVATE SECTOR ATTENDED TO LEARN AND ARTICULATE EFFECTIVE HANDS ON STRATEGIES AND TECHNIQUES FOR ADDRESSING DRUG ABUSE PROBLEMS IN PUBLIC HOUSING THE NATIONAL CONFERENCE DID GIVE US A DESCRIPTION THE PROBLEM IT ALSO REINFORCED THE NOTION A LOCAL PROBLEM NEEDING LOCAL SOLUTION TOWARD THAT END FIVE REGIONAL CONFERENCES ATTENDED BY OVER WERE SUBSEQUENTLY HELD DURING THE MONTHS OF NOVEMBER AND DECEMBER IN BOSTON Kansas City San Antonio San Francisco Nashville provide FURTHER INFORMATION TO ALL WHO ARE FACED WITH DRUG ABUSE IN THEIR COMMUNITIES AND GAIN THE INSIGHT OF THOSE WHO HAD FACED THE PROBLEM AND WON WlTHOUT FAIL THE CONFERENCES EMPHASIZED THE NEED FOR COORDINATED PLANNING AND ACTION REPRESENTATIVES SPOKE ABOUT LOCAL SUCCESSES AND FAILURES SOHE TOLD HOW THEY HAD DEVELOPED COOPERATIVE RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN THE HOUSING AUTHORITY RESIDENTS AND LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICIALS THEIR FRUSTRATION AT GETTING LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICIALS TO ARREST DRUG PUSHERS IN PUBLIC HOUSING SOME THE DIFFICULTY THEY IN WORKING WITH SOCIAL SERVICE AGENCIES IN THEIR COMMUNITY AND OTHERS PRAISED THE GOOD WORKING RELATIONSHIP WHICH HAS DEVELOPED MANY MANY EXPRESSED FRUSTRATION AT THE DIFFICULTY AND SLOWNESS THE EVICTION PROCESS Specific ADMISSION OR SCREENING POLICIES EVICTION POLICIES AND security housing take ALL APPLICANTS WHO QUALIFY UNDER THE INCOME STANDARDS REGARDLESS OF ANY OTHER FACTORS SUCH KNOWN CRIMINAL OR DRUG ACTIVITY OTHERS THEY MUST ADMIT ALL WHO ARE POOR ENOUGH FACT HUD REGULATIONS ALLOW HOUSING AUTHORITIES TO SCREEN APfLICANTS ADMISSION TO PUBLIC HOUSING AND WITH OTHER LANDLORDS TO REFUSE TO HOUSE PEOPLE WHOSE BACKGROUND PREDICTS A TROUBLED TENANCY Many eviction HUD NOW REQUIRE AN ADMINISTRATIVE HEARING BY THE HOUSING AUTHORITY PRIOR TO EVICTION FROM PUBLIC HOUSING ThIS REQUIREMENT WAS MANDATED BY SEVERAL COURT DECISIONS WHICH THAT FEDERAL DUE PROCESS REQUIREMENTS WERE NOT ALWAYS BEING MET IN LOCAL LANDLORD TENANT COURTS THE PRESENT POLICY UNDENIABLY MAKES EVICTION VERY DIFFICULT AND TIME CONSUMING HUD IS NOW REGULATION WHICH WILL FACILITATE THE EVICTION OF PROBLEM RESIDENTS FROM PUBLIC HOUSING A MORE STREAMLINED BUT STILL LEGALLY ACCEPTABLE PROCEDURE common issue security REPRESENTATIVES BELIEVE THAT IMPROVED SECURITY COULD BE DONE WITH PASSIVE SYSTEMS SUCH SECURITY ENTRY SYSTEMS SOME ADVOCATED PRIVATE SECURITY SERVICES PAID FOR BY THE HOUSING AUTHORITY "-\ local POLICE DEPARTMENTS EXPERIENCE COMMISSIONER IN KANSAS City believe last solution Kansas City time high crihe rate public HOUSING WE ARHED GUARDS EMPLOYED BY THE HOUSING AUTHORITY IN WE ELIMINATED THE GUARD SERVICE AND WORKED Kansas City Missouri police department develop BETTER SYSTEM OF RESPONDING TO CALLS FROM RESIDENTS WE ALSO A SERIES OF MEETINGS WITH RESIDENTS HOUSING AUTHORITY MANAGEMENT THE LOCAL POLICE DEPARTMENT POLICE WHO WOULD ACTUALLY BE PATROLLING THE PROPERTIES ThIS US TO DEVELOP A LEVEL OF TRUST SO THE RESIDENTS WOULD FEEL MORE CONFIDENT IN REPORTING CRIMINAL ACTIVITY TO THE POLICE Resident management important METHOD OF IMPROVING MANAGEMENT OF PROPERTIES AND ENSURING RESIDENT WITHOUT SUBSTANTIAL RESIDENT COMMITMENT IT IS OBVIOUSLY NOT POSSIBLE TO STOP DRUG ACTIVITY IN THE PUBLIC HOUSING COMMUNITY Department Housing Urban Development THE COMPREHENSIVE IMPROVEMENT ASSISTANCE PROGRAM CIAP THE MAIN FUNDING VEHICLE HUD HAS FOR HOUSING AUTHORITIES TO COMBAT THE DRUG PROBLEM CIAP ARE PRESENTLY AVAILABLE FOR MODERNIZATION OF PUBLIC HOUSING
