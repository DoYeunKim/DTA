IN THE FIRST HALF WE APPLIED FOR SUCH WARRANTS % CR WERE FOR CRACK THE PICTURE THE CRACK PROBLEM IN NEW YORK CITY STUDY IN FRUSTRATION WE ARE TRYING TO AVOID DROWNING IN A SEA OF DRUGS IN NEW YORK AND THE POLICE DEPARTMENT HAS RESPONDED IN SEVERAL POSITIVE WAYS OUR BASIC APPROACH TO THE ENFORCEMENT CHALLENGE IS TO CONDUCT UNDERCOVER BUY BUST OPERATIONS REINFORCED BY INCREASED UNIFORMED POLICE PATROLS ON MAY WE ANNOUNCED THE ESTABLISHMENT THE SPECIAL ANTI CRACK UNIT CONSISTING EXPERIENCED INVESTIGATORS THESE MEN AND WOMEN SUPPLEMENT THE NARCOTICS DIVISION PERSONNEL AND REPRESENT A SUBSTANTIAL COMMITMENT OF RESOURCES BY THE DEPARTMENT THIS THE FIRST TIME THAT AN ENTIRE UNIT HAS BEEN DESIGNATED TO DEAL WITH A SPECIFIC DRUG THE COMMAND HAS CITYWIDE JURISDICTION AND IS HIGHLY MOBILE TO PROVIDE AN IMMEDIATE RESPONSE TO COMPLAINTS OF CRACK TRAFFICKING ANYWHERE IN THE CITY TO DATE THE UNIT HAS A TOTAL ARRESTS FOR SALE AND POSSESSION OF eRACK % OF THEM FOR FELONIES THESE ARRESTS WE WERE ABLE TO CLOSE THESE LOCATIONS FOR ILLEGAL USE AND DEVELOP NEW CONFIDENTIAL INFORMANTS WE HAVE ALSO INSTITUTED A SPECIAL DRUG ENFORCEMENT PROGRAM IN THE WASHINGTON HEIGHTS SECTION OF MANHATTAN KNOWN OPERATION " CLEAN HEIGHTS ", THIS INITIATIVE IS GEARED TOWARD AGGRESSIVE ON STREET BUY BUST ACTIONS AND STRESSES THE USE OF PREMISES SEARCH WARRANTS TO GET AT THE WHO MOVED INDOORS UNIFORMED POLICE OFFICERS PLAY A VERY IMPORTANT PART IN RAIDS A DETERRENT FORCE PREVENTING RE OCCUPATION AREAS WHERE DRUG PUSHERS HAVE BEEN ARRESTED SINCE APRIL OPERATION CLEAN HEIGHTS HAS PRODUCED ARRESTS THE SEIZURE OR FIREARMS VEHICLES THE COMMITTEE IS FAMILIAR WITH OPERATION PRESSURE POINT THIS PROGRAM IS NOW IN A MAINTENANCE MODE IN THREE SECTIONS THE CITY CENTRAL HARLEM THE LOWER EAST SIDE AND THE STREET UNION SQUARE AREA WE THAT PRESSURE POINT IS IN A MAINTENANCE MODE IT HAS PASSED THE INTENSIVE BUY BUST ACTIONS PHASE TODAY WE MAINTAIN THE STABILITY OF THESE AREAS THE CONTINUED POLICE PRESENCE TO DEAL WITH SPORADIC INCIDENTS OF DRUG SALES THIS COMMITTEE LAST NOVEMBER WE HAVE DEMONSTRATED THE SUCCESS THIS TACTIC NOT ONLY BECAUSE BLATANT ON STREET DRUG TRAFFICKING HAS BEEN LARGELY CURTAILED IN OUR PRESSURE POINT AREAS BUT ALSO BECAUSE REPORTS MAJOR CRIMES SUCH ROBBERY BURGLARY AND GRAND LARCENY HAVE SHOWN DRAMATIC AND SUSTAINED REDUCTIONS WITHIN EACH THE TARGET NEIGHBORHOODS THIS WAS ACCOMPLISHED WITHOUT ANY SIGNIFICANT DISPLACEMENT OF DRUG TRAFFICKING TO ADJOINING NEIGHBORHOODS WITH THESE INITIATIVES THE DEPARTMENT CONTINUES TO SUPPORT BOTH STATE AND FEDERAL LEGISLATION WHICH WOULD LOWER AGGREGATE WEIGHT REQUIREMENTS FOR SALE AND POSSESSION OF CRACK IN FAIRNESS TO THIS FORUM HOWEVER SAY WE HAVE REACHED A STAGE IN NEW YORK CITY S DRUG CRISIS WHERE THE RESOURCES AVAILABLE TO THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM ARE ON THE VERGE OF BEING OUTSTRIPPED BY THE CONDITION THE DRUG CRISIS WE ARE FACING IS AS MUCH A WAR AS WORLD WAR II WAS EXPORT ILLEGAL DRUGS TO AMERICA ARE GUILTY NOTHING LESS THAN SUBJECTING US TO A PEARL HARBOR IN SLOW MOTION IN THIS COUNTRY MANY OF THEM ILLEGAL ALIENS WHO IMPORT AND DISTRIBUTE ILLEGAL DRUGS ARE COMMITTING ACTS OF TREASON OUR DRUG WAR IS ONE THAT MUST BE FOUGHT BOTH AT HOME AND ABROAD WITH EQUAL ATTENTION GIVEN TO SUPPLY AND DEMAND THE SUPPLY SIDE OUTSIDE OUR BORDERS PRESSURE MUST BE BROUGHT TO BEAR ON THOSE NATIONS WHICH CULTIVATE AND EXPORT ILLEGAL DRUGS THIS RESPONSIBILITY THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT THE STATE DEPARTMENT THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT THE CENTRAL INTELLIGENCE AGENCY AND THE PRESIDENT HIMSELF ARE FAILING IN THIS RESPONSIBILITY IN MANY CASES THEY WORKING AGAINST EACH OTHER TO ELIMINATE SUPPLY WE MUST ALSO STRIVE FOR IMPLEMENTATION OF MANDATORY SHORT TERM INCARCERATION FOR DRUG TRAFFICKERS THIS BE DONE IF INCREASED FUNDING IS MADE AVAILABLE FOR LOCALITIES ENGAGED IN DRUG ENFORCEMENT WE NEED FUNDING NOT JUST FOR POLICING BUT FOR THE OTHER COMPONENTS THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM IN NEW YORK CITY FOR EXAMPLE WE EFFECTED ABOUT DRUG ARRESTS DURING YEAR IN MANHATTAN OF PEOPLE CONVICTED OF MISDEMEANORS SELLING OR POSSESSING SMALL QUANTITIES OF DRUGS JAIL TIME BEYOND THAT SERVED BETWEEN ARREST AND ARRAIGNMENT THE STATE S PRISON SYSTEM THEN AS NOW OPERATES AT % CAPACITY WITH PRISON CELLS IN THE STATE WE CANNOT POSSIBLY HOUSE ALL THE DRUG OFFENDERS NOT TO MENTION MURDERERS ROBBERS RAPISTS AND BURGLARS WITH TRIAL JUDGES IN CRIMINAL COURT IN MANHATTAN AND CITYWIDE WE CAN NOT EXPECT TO TRY ALL THE FELONY DRUG ARRESTS THAT D A s REDUCE TO MISDEMEANORS TO CLEAR CALENDARS FELONIES REDUCED TO MISDEMEANORS CAN BE DISPOSED OF AT ARRAIGNMENT WHERE / OF ALL CRIMINAL COURT JUDGES NOW SIT NEW YORK CITY POLICE DEPARTMENT COULD PROBABLY DOUBLE ITS DRUG ARRESTS GIVEN ADDED RESOURCES BUT WHO WILL PROSECUTE ANOTHER ARRESTEES TRY THEM AND WHERE WILL THEY BE INCARCERATED INCREASING ARREST ACTIVITY WITHOUT THE LIKELIHOOD OF APPROPRIATE PUNISHMENT MAKES MOCKERY THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM POLICE MANPOWER WITHOUT INCREASING JUDGES PROSECUTORS AND JAIL SPACE PLAYS A CRUEL JOKE ON THE PUBLIC DEMAND SIDE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT MUST PAY MORE ATTENTION TO THIS DRUG INFESTED CULTURE THERE SOMETHING TRAGICALLY WRONG WITH OUR VALUES A SOCIETY WHEN DRUG ABUSE HAS BECOME SUCH A COMMON AND ATTRACTIVE PAST TIME THERE SOMETHING WRONG WITH OUR PRIORITIES WHEN WE ALLOW PUSHEkS OF LETHAL DRUGS TO PROSPER AND THE USERS THE CHILDREN OUR COUNTRY TO DIE THIS COMMITTEE IS FAMILIAR WITH SPECDA THE PROGRAM SPONSORED JOINTLY BY THE NEW YORK CITY POLICE DEPARTMENT AND THE BOARD OF EDUCATION SCHOOL • PROGRAM TO EDUCATE AND CONTROL DRUG ABUSE WE ARE COMMITTED TO THE BELIEF THAT ENFORCEMENT EFFORTS MUST BE COUPLED WITH EDUCATION TO TEACH KIDS HOW TO SAY " NO " TO DRUGS IN THE FIRST PLACE WE BELIEVE IN THIS PROGRAM AND WE ARE EXPANDING IT THE RECORD TODAY A VIDEOTAPE DESCRIBING THE SPECDA CURRICULUM CLASSROOM THROUGH AN WEEK CURRICULUM AND HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS AN ASSEMBLY PROGRAM — WE ARE CURRENTLY IN THE SCHOOL DISTRICTS IN THE CITY BY SEPTEMBER WE BE IN ALMOST HALF THE CITY S SCHOOL DISTRICTS WE THAT SPECDA REACHES THE RIGHT PEOPLE IN THE RIGHT PLACE AT THE RIGHT TIME THE SAD TRUTH HOWEVER ONLY MILLION THE BILLION EDUCATION DEPARTMENT BUDGET IS ALLOCATED FOR DRUG ABUSE EDUCATION CAN HARDLY CALL THAT A DOLLAR ACKNOWLEDGMENT A NATIONAL " TOP PRIORITY ". CONCLUSION * MANDATORY SHORT TERM SENTENCING COUPLED WITH FURTHER INCREASES IN DRUG ARREST ACTIVITY WILL PROVIDE SOME IMMEDIATE RELIEF TO THE SUPPLY SIDE THE PROBLEM ON THE HOME FRONT A FEDERAL COMMITMENT TO CLOSING OUR BORDERS TO ILLICIT DRUGS WILL REDUCE THE FLOW OF DRUGS INTO THE UNITED AND HEW YORK CITY CERTAIN THAT LONG TERM DRUG ABUSE EDUCATION TREATMENT AND REHABILITATION ARE AN ABSOLUTE NECESSITY IF WE TO HONESTLY ADDRESS THE DEMAND SIDE THE PROBLEM n IN THEODORE ROOSEVELT CONVENED AN INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE TO STAMP OUT WORLD WIDE DRUG TRAFFICKING EVERY PRESIDENT SINCE HAS

IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE PRICE INCREASE THE DUAL SMUGGLING BECAME A PROBLEM CHEMICALS FOR PROCESSING INTO COLOMBIA AND COCAINE HCL OUT THE DRUG TRAFFICKERS REALIZED IT WOULD BE CONSIDERABLY CHEAPER TO PROCESS THE COCAINE CLOSER TO THE DISTRIBUTION POINTS MAINLY THE U S A .) AND THEIR SMUGGLING ROUTES INTO THE U S WERE ALREADY ESTABLISHED THUS COCA BASE COULD BE SMUGGLED AND ETHER AND OTHER NECESSARY CHEMICALS WERE PLENTIFUL IN THE U S A THE RESULT HAS THE ESTABLISHMENT

IN OPERATION FOR ABOUT A MONTH OUR INVESTIGATION IN CONJUNCTION HITH FEDERAL AND LOCAL AUTHORITIES DISCLOSED IT THE CAPABILITY TO PROCESS KILOS OF COCAINE IN FULL PRODUCTION THE LAB CAPABILITY OF PRODUCING KILOS OF PURE COCAINE EVERY THREE DAYSI IT HAS LATER DETERMINED THE LAB HAD PRODUCED KILOS OF C0CAINE1 AFTER PROCESSING THIS COCAINE HAS THEN TAKEN TO NEH YORK CITY FOR DISTRIBUTION BASED ON OUR PAST INVESTIGATIVE EXPERIENCES SOME THIS PRODUCT EVENTUALLY FOUND ITS ifAY TO THE STREETS OF UPSTATE NEH YORK DISCOVERY THE LAB IN NINDEN HAS SUBSEQUENTLY FOLLOHED BY THE DISCOVERY OTHER

% HOLLOW INVESTIGATION DISCLOSED A DEFINITE CONNECTION BETWEEN THE CARTEL S INVOLVED WITH THE NEW YORK STATE COCAINE LABS AND SIMILAR OPERATIONS IN NORTH CAROLINA AND VIRGINIA THE TREND HAS CONTINUED INTO THIS YEAR THIS VERMONT STATE POLICE A SIMILAR PROCESSING LAB IN POULTNEY VERMONT IMMEDIATELY ADJACENT TO THE NEW YORK BORDER AT THIS LAB WERE CONNECTED TO NEW YORK IN HAY THIS YEAR OUR TROOPERS UNCOVERED TWO MORE OPERATIONAL LABS IN UPSTATE NEW YORK A FULLY OPERATING LAB WAS INTERDICTED IN COXSACKIE AND FOLLOW UP INVESTIGATIONS DISCOVERED A HASTILY DISBANDED LAB IN SOUTH FALLSBURG APPEARANCE THESE LABS TENDS TO COINCIDE WITH THE SUCCESS THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT IN REDUCING THE FLOW OF CHEMICALS SUCH ETHER TO SOUTH AMERICA THE BEGAN TQ MOVE THEIR PROCESSING OPERATIONS TO THE UNITED IT IS IMPORTANT TO RECOGNIZE THE PRODUCT THAT PROCESSED COCA LEAF USUALLY IN THE FORM OF COCA PASTE NOT GROWN ON THE NORTH AMERICAN CONTINENT THIS PRODUCT IS BROUGHT ACROSS OUR BORDERS WE THE STATE LEVEL THE LAW ENFORCEMENT SECTOR HAVE NO MEANS PREVENTING THIS IMPORTATION INTO THE UNITED WE CAN ARE DOING WE CAN TO LOCATE THIS CONTRABAND AFTER IT IS BROUGHT INTO THE STATE BUT IT IS PRIMARILY THE RESPONSIBILITY THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT TO INTERDICT ITS IMPORTATION AT THE BORDER LIKE TO POINT OUT TO THE COMMITTEE THAT IN COCAINE PROCESSING LAB AFTER COCAINE PROCESSING LAB CASE WE RUN INTO A COMMON ENTITY ILLEGAL ALIEN THE PEOPLE WE AT THESE SITES ARE NQI CITIZENS OUR STATE OR EVEN THE UNITED THEY ARE ILLEGAL ALIENS USUALLY FROM COLOMBIA SINCE THE DISCOVERY THE MINDEN LAB WE HAVE HAD INVOLVEMENT WITH SIX PROCESSING LABORATORIES IN OPERATION IN OUR STATE WE HAVE MADE ARRESTS IN ALL INSTANCES AND IN FIVE THE SIX INSTANCES THE ARRESTS INVOLVED ILLEGAL COLOMBIAN ALIENS ARRESTS IN VERMONT INVOLVED ILLEGAL ALIENS THE LABS UNCOVERED Iff NORTH CAROLINA AND VIRIGINIA WHICH WERE CONNECTED TO THE ONES IN NEW YORK ALSO INVOLVED A COLOMBIAN ELEMENT THE ABILITY OF ILLEGAL ALIENS TO ENTER THIS COUNTRY ON A REGULAR BASIS IS AN ISSUE THAT MUST BE ADDRESSED BY THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT IT BEYOND THE CAPABILITIES OF STATE AND LOCAL POLICE STRONGLY RECOMMEND TO THIS COMMITTEE THAT INCREASED FEDERAL RESOURCES BE COMMITTED TO COMBAT THE CAPABILITIES THE NARCOTICS CARTELS TO SMUGGLE THEIR PRODUCT INTO OUR COUNTRY AND AT THE SAME TIME DEFY OUR IMMIGRATION LAWS IN SENDING THEIR WORKERS * ONTO THE STREETS OF NEW YORK ALSO ASKED ME TO ADDRESS THE ISSUE OF WHAT ACHIEVEMENTS FROM OUR INCREASED ALLOCATION OF MANPOWER TO THE NEW YORK CITY AREA THE ASSIGNMENT THE ADDITIONAL INVESTIGATORS COMMENCED IN JANUARY THIS YEAR WITH r ASSIGNMENT OF APPROXIMATELY TWENTY FIVE ADDITIONAL INVESTIGATORS TO NEW YORK CITY INVESTIGATIONS DURING CURRENT FISCAL YEAR WE ANTICIPATE ADDING ANOTHER FIFTY NARCOTICS INVESTIGATORS TO NEW YORK CITY INVESTIGATIONS PREVIOUSLY STATED IN MOST INSTANCES WE ASSIGN THESE MEMBERS TO JOINT OPERATIONS WITH THE NEW YORK CITY POLICE DEPARTMENT AND DRUG ENFORCEMENT ADMINISTRATION UNDER THE AUSPICIES THE DRUG ENFORCEMENT TASK FORCE REVIEW OF RECENT INVESTIGATIVE EFFORTS SINCE WE INCREASED OUR COMMITMENT TO THE NEW YORK CITY INVESTIGATIONS REVEALS BOTH AN ENCOURAGING TREND AND PRIMA FACIE JUSTIFICATION FOR SUCH ASSIGNMENTS FOR EXAMPLE A JOINT INVESTIGATION VIA DRUG ENFORCEMENT TASK FORCE DURING MARCH RESULTED IN THE ARREST OF TWO ISRAELI NATIONALS THE SEIZURE OF SIX POUNDS OF HEROIN ON STATEN ISLAND IN APRIL OUR TROOPERS WORKING IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE DRUG ENFORCEMENT ADMINISTRATION AND STATEWIDE ORGANIZED CRIME TASK FORCE RAIDED TWO APARTMENTS IN QUEENS AND SEIZED POUNDS OF COCAINE AND ARRESTED TWO COLOMBIAN NATIONALS A SIMILAR INVESTIGATION WE CONDUCTED THAT SAME MONTH INTO NARCOTICS TRAFFICKING IN MANHATTAN BROOKLYN QUEENS BRONX WESTCHESTER AND ROCKLAND COUNTIES RESULTED IN THE ARREST OF FORTY DEFENDANTS ON NARCOTICS CHARGES SEIZED THE TIME THESE ARRESTS WAS OVER CASH TWO POUNDS OF HEROIN FOUR POUNDS OF COCAINE TEN POUNDS OF HIGH GRADE MARIJUANA VEHICLES HANDGUNS TWO UZI SUBMACHINE GUNS A SILENCER IN MAY OUR TROOPERS CONCLUDED A LENGTHY INVESTIGATION ON LONG ISLAND CONNECTED TO NEW YORK CITY THAT RESULTED IN THE ARREST OF SEVEN SOUTH AMERICAN NATIONALS ON CONSPIRACY CHARGES FOR THE DISTRIBUTION AND SALE OF MULTI KILO LEVELS OP COCAINE THE GROUP HAS BELIEVED TO BE RESPONSIBLE SMUGGLING OVER KILOS OF COCAINE A MONTH FROM COLOMBIA INTO LONG ISLAND ANDTHE METRO NEW YORK CITY AREA IT BELIEVED TO BE THE LARGEST SMUGGLING CONSPIRACY EVER UNCOVERED IN LONG ISLAND IN THAT SAME MONTH IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE DRUG ENFORCEMENT TASK FORCE ANOTHER INVESTIGATION RESULTED IN THE SEIZURE OF POUNDS OF COCAINE AND THE ARREST OF NINE COLOMBIANS IN YET ANOTHER INVESTIGATION OUR PERSONNEL CONDUCTED RAIDS IN QUEENS THAT RESULTED IN THE SEIZURE OF THIRTY POUNDS OF COCAINE AND ARREST OF SIX COLOMBIANS THIS GROUP HAS CONNECTED TO A DISTRIBUTION SYSTEM FOR UPSTATE THAT RESULTED IN SHIPMENTS OP COCAINE FROM NEH YORK CITY TO UTICA SIMILAR ARRESTS HERE MADE IN UTICA CITE OTHER INSTANCES OUR INCREASED EFFECTIVENESS AND CAPABILITIES A RESULT THE INCREASED RESOURCES BEING GIVEN US BY STATE GOVERNMENT TO COMBAT THIS PROBLEM ATTACHED AN ADDENDUM TO THIS STATEMENT A COPY OF ARTICLES FROM THE MOST RECENT ISSUE OUR DEPARTMENTAL MAGAZINE THE TROOPER WHICH A MORE COMPREHENSIVE OVERVIEW OUR RECENT ACCOMPLISHMENTS MUST ALSO BE REALISTIC AND ACKNOWLEDGE THAT DESPITE WHAT WE PERCEIVE TO BE OUR GROWING EFFECTIVENESS IN DETECTING Page NARCOTICS TRAFFICKERS WE CONTINUE TO EXPERIENCE % A GROWING PROBUM WITH NARCOTICS ADDICTION WE CONTINUE TO INCREASE OUR RESOURCES AND CAPABILITIES WE HOPE WE CAN HAVE A SIGNIFICANT IMPACT AT OUR LEVEL OF INVOLVEMENT AGAIN IF THERE INCREASED EFFECTIVENESS ON THE PART THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT IN REDUCING THE ABILITY THE NARCOTICS CARTELS TO IMPORT THEIR PRODUCT PEOPLE WE MAY ONLY BE OPERATING A REVOLVING DOOR ARE OF COURSE OTHER ASPECTS THAT GO BEYOND THE SECURITY OF OUR BORDERS NEW YORK CITY REPRESENTATIVES CAN TESTIFY TO THE PROBLEMS WITH OVERCROWDED COURT CALENDARS THE RESULTANT PROBLEMS THEY PRODUCE IT GOOD TO ARREST A NARCOTICS VIOLATOR IF THAT VIOLATOR KNOWS THAT AN OVER TAXED LEGAL SYSTEM GUARANTEES THERE A SMALL CHANCE HE GO TO JAIL WHAT GOOD IT DO IF WE CAN IMPLEMENT A MANDATORY DEPORTATION POLICY FOR NON CITIZEN NARCOTICS TRAFFICKERS IF THEY OUR INSECURE BORDERS WILL ALLOW THEM EASY ACCESS BACK INTO THE COUNTRY WHENEVER THEY SO CHOOSE ALL WE DO THEN IS CREATE A SHUTTLE SERVICE WE ARE EXPERIENCING A " CRACK EPIDEMIC " IN NEW YORK CITY BRIEFLY COMMENTED ON THE PROBLEMS OF OUR OVERCROWDED COURT CALENDARS WE ALSO AN OVERCROWDED CORRECTIONAL SYSTEM THESE ADD TO THE CRACK PROBLEM LEGISLATION CURRENTLY BEING PROPOSED TO AMEND THE NEW YORK STATE PENAL LAW IN RELATION TO THE

ABUSE AND CONTROL CONGRESSMAN CHARLES B RANGEL CHAIRMAN AIDS UPDATE Friday July United Court International Trade Ceremonial Courtroom One Federal Plaza New York City AIDS UPDATE Beny J Primm M D MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS THE COMMITTEE TO THANK YOU ALLOWING ME TO COME BEFORE YOU TO UPDATE THE COMMITTEE ON THE STATUS THE DEVASTATING DISEASE OF ACQUIRED IMMUNE DEFICIENCY SYNDROME AND ITS PRECURSOR THE AIDS RELATED COMPLEX OF JUNE THERE HAVE BEEN CASES REPORTED TO THE FOR DISEASE CONTROL CDC IN ATLANTA INCLUDED IN THAT REPORT WAS KNOWN DEATHS AND COUNTLESS OTHERS THAT ARE EXPECTED TO CONTRACT THE DISEASE GOOD FORTUNE TO BE AMONG PROMINENT RESEARCHERS CHOSEN TO ATTEND A CONFERENCE SPONSORED BY THE U S PUBLIC HEALTH SERVICE TO PLAN FOR THE AIDS PROBLEM THE NEXT FIVE YEARS IT WAS CONCLUDED THAT BY THE YEAR THERE WOULD BE REPORTED TO THE CDC BETWEEN CASES THERE WOULD BE BETWEEN TO DEATHS THESE BUT THEY PALE WHEN COMPARED TO SOME COUN ^^ f IN CENTRAL AFRICA LIKE ZAIRE UGANDA RWANDA AND OTHERS WHERE THERE HAVE BEEN PREDICTIONS ONE HALF THE TOTAL POPULATION DYING IN TEN YEARS THESE REPORTS THAT YOU MAY BEGIN TO PERCEIVE THE GLOBAL IMPACT THIS DISEASE LEADER THE FREE WORLD HOW IMPORTANT IT IS FOR US TO SET EXAMPLES OF HOW TO MANAGE GREAT NUMBERS A POPULATION AFFECTED BY THIS PROBLEM IT THE CONCENSUS THIS DISEASE IS TRANSMITTED BY SEXUAL PARENTERAL AND PERINATAL CONTACT WITH THE HUMAN IMMUNODEFICIENT VIRUS OR HIV THE NEW INTERNATIONAL NAME BY WHICH THE VIRUS IS NOW BEING CALLED / ALTHOUGH THIS DISEASE HAS BEEN MOST OFTEN RECOGNIZED IN HOMOSEXUAL AND BISEXUAL MEN AND INTRAVENOUS DRUG USERS IT IS CLEAR XT DOES NOT DISCRIMINATE BY SEX RACE AGE ETHNIC GROUP OR SEXUAL ORIENTATION ARE HOWEVER A DISPROPORTIONATE NUMBER BLACKS *), HISPANICS AFFECTED NATIONALLY BUT HERE IN N Y C BLACKS REPRESENT % HISPANICS % THE TOTAL CASES THERE STILL REMAINS A VOID OF PREVENTION AND EDUCATION PPOGRAMS IN MANY AREAS OF NEW YORK CITY SUCH CONGRESSMAN RANGEL S OWN CONGRESSIONAL DISTRICT WHICH RANKS IN THE WORLD IN THE RECORDED NUMBER OF DEATHS PER POPULATION CLEARLY THIS PROBLEM NEEDS IMMEDIATE ATTENTION STARTLING AND EXTREMELY SERIOUS AND ALARMING THE DEFENSE DEPARTMENT S REPORT ON THE VIRUS ANTIBODY PREVALENCE IN U S MILITARY RECRUIT APPLICANTS THE SCREENED POPULATIONS WERE YOUNG IN THEIR LATE TEENS %), EARLY TWENTIES % MALE % WHITE / WHITE MALES TESTED WERE POSITIVE THE ANTIBODY AND / BLACKS AND TWICE / AS HIGH MEN THAN FOR WOMEN / ). WHAT DISTURBING HERE WHO TEST POSITIVE THE ANTIBODY HAVE BEEN INFECTED AND ARE INFECTIOUS WITHOUT SYMPTOMS POSING A SILENT POTENTIAL DANGER FOR SOCIETY IF THEY ARE SEXUALLY INTIMATE WITHOUT PROTECTION OR IF THEY SHARE NEEDLES BLOOD OR BLOOD PRODUCTS INTRAVENOUS DRUG USE REMAINS THE MOST SUSPECT AVENUE THE GREATER TRANSMISSION THE VIRUS INTO THE HETEROSEXUAL COMMUNITY THERE HAVE BEEN MAJOR INITIATIVES ON THE PART THE NATIONAL INSTITUTE ON DRUG ABUSE AND LOCALLY THE N Y / STATE DIVISION OF SUBSTANCE ABUSE SERVICES TO THWART THIS DANGER HOWEVER ARE ESTIMATED TO AMERICANS INFECTED WITH THE VIRUS AND A SIZABLE NUMBER THESE ARE NEITHER HOMO SEXUAL / BISEXUAL MEN NOR INTRAVENOUS DRUG USERS TWENTY PERCENT OF NEW YORK CITY S PROSTITUTES TESTED WERE POSITIVE THE ANTIBODY TO HIV THIS LATTER DATA COMBINED WITH THE INFORMATION CONCERNING MILITARY RECRUITS SUGGESTS OTHER AVENUES OF TRANSMISSION THE VIRUS TO THE HETEROSEXUAL COMMUNITY MANY EXPERTS BELIEVE THERE IS GROSS UNDERESTIMATION UNDERREPORTING OR UNDERASCERTAINMENT OF AIDS AND ARC CASES AND THAT THIS BEING DELIBERATELY DONE BY HEALTH CARE PROFESSIONALS IN ORDER NOT TO BE LABELED A PHYSICIAN OR HOSPITAL DEALS WITH THIS DREADFUL DISEASE THE HEALTH CARE DELIVERY SYSTEM MUST BE MORE CLOSELY MONITORED TO INSURE THAT ALL PATIENTS ARE TREATED ADEQUATELY WITH APPROPRIATE FOLLOW UP SUPPORT CARE DRUG ABUSE AND DEPENDENCE HAS NOW BECOME THE SECOND LEADING MENTAL HEALTH PROBLEM FOR OUR NATIONt AIDS OFTEN PRESENTS A CENTRAL NERVOUS SYSTEM DYSFUNCTION AND MANY AIDS PATIENTS SUFFER FROM WELL DEFINED AND OFTEN TREATABLE FOCAL LESIONS RESULTING FROM OPPORTUNISTIC INFECTIONS A MORE COMMON GENERALIZED ENCEPHALOPATHY WHICH INCLUDES DEMENTIA A PROMINENT FEATURE THESE SERIOUS MENTAL HEALTH PROBLEMS OF AIDS ARE ADDING TO THE ALREADY OVERBURDENED MENTAL HEALTH TREATMENT NETWORK THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT MUST ACT TO ASSIST US IN MEETING THIS CRISIS TO AVOID THE SERIOUS PERSONAL CONSEQUENCES THIS DISEASE THE OUTLOOK FOR THE DEVELOPMENT A VACCINE OR EFFECTIVE TREATMENT THERAPIES REMAINS DIM AND BLEAK ALMOST ALL THE HOPEFUL MEDICATIONS RESEARCHED HAVE SHOWN LITTLE PROMISE METHOD SHOWN EARLY SUCCESS IS BONE MARROW TRANSPLANTS TRANSPLANTS AN IDENTICAL TWIN IN ONE OUT THREE CASES SHOWED A POSITIVE CHANGE AND REVERSE OF AN IMPAIRED IMMUNE RESPONSE HOWEVER THIS METHOD IS EXPENSIVE AND CAN ONLY BE IN A LIMITED NUMBER OF CASES IN CONCLUSION MR CHAIRMAN RECOMMEND THAT HOSPICES MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES AND OTHER SUPPORT SYSTEMS HOUSING AND PROFESSIONAL CAREGIVERS FOR THIS POPULATION MUST BE PROVIDED IN ORDER TO INSURE DIGNITY OF DYING A MORE PLEASANT TRANSITION FROM LIFE TO DEATH PREVENTION EDUCATION EFFORTS MUST BE TARGETED TO THOSE COMMUNITIES WHERE INCIDENCE AND PREVALENCE OF DRUG USE IS ENDEMIC THEY MUST BE CULTURALLY SENSITIVE HIGHLY ACCESSIBLE AND NUMEROUS _ IN ORDER TO COMBAT THE HIGH RISK BEHAVIORS THAT CAN LEAD TO AIDS FEAR ANXIETY AND OSTRACISM THE AFFECTED POPULATION THANK YOU i ROM THE OFI -'
