GENTLEMEN LET ME BEGIN BY EXPLAINING THAT MY JURIDSICTION IS BERKSHIRE COUNTY BERKSHIRE COUNTY MOST WESTERN PART OF MASSACHUSETTS IT IS BORDERED BY THE OF CONNECTICUT / NEW YORK AND VERMONT IT CITIES AND TOWNS RANGING IN SIZE FROM POPULATIONS OF LESS THAN / TO THE CITY OF PITTSFIELD WITH A POPULATION IN EXCESS / TRULY IT IS TYPICAL NEW ENGLAND YOU YOU HEAR / THE HORRORS OF URBAN DRUG DEALING THE PROBLEMS OF PROTECTING THE SHORELINE / ALL OF WHICH YOU ARE VERY / VERY IMPORTANT IF BERKSHIRE COUNTY IS TYPICAL NEW ENGLAND / THEN COCAINE AND MARIJUANA ARE THE DRUGS OF CHOICE / COCAINE BEING THE MOST SIGNIFICANT LAW ENFORCEMENT PROBLEM SIMPLY IT THE BIGGEST PROFIT MAKER INFORMANTS TALK ABOUT COCAINE THAN THEY DO MARIJUANA MY SUSPICION THAT MARIJUANA USE IS SO PREVALENT IT HAS BECOME VIRTUALLY INGRAINED IN THE SOCIETAL FABRIC WE KNOW THAT THE INDUSTRIAL SETTINGS WE HAVE IN BERKSHIRE COUNTY REGULAR USE OF MARIJUANA DURING THE WORK DAY IS NOT UNUSUAL IF AS HAS BEEN SAID LAW ENFORCEMENT IS IN A WAR AGAINST DRUG TRAFFICKERS THEN CAN TELL YOU THE BERKSHIRE PERSPECTIVE IF WE HAVEN T THE WAR WE WILL SOON ARE SOME REASONS THIS ~ WE ARE LOSING THE WAR IN MASSACHUSETTS BECAUSE SOME OF OUR LAWS ARE INADEQUATE FOR EXAMPLE SALE OF MARIJUANA DOES NOT BECOME A FELONY UNTIL YOU DISTRIBUTE IT IN LOTS LBS OR MORE MEANS A FIRST OFFENSE SALE OF A9 LBS OF MARIJUANA TO AN UNDERCOVER NARCOTICS OFFICER CREATES NO GREATER RISK OF INCARCERATION IN MASSACHUSETTS THAN AN ARREST OPERATING UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF INTOXICATING LIQUOR FIRST OFFENSE TRUE COOPERATION BY ALL AGENCIES JOKE HEADLINE HUNTING NORM STATE AND FEDERAL COOPERATION IN MY END THE WOODS DOES NOT EXIST THE REASON FOR IT SIMPLE IT EASIER TO MAKE AN ARREST IN BOSTON THAN IT IS IN THE BERKS HI RES ,, AND YOU GET HEADLINES IN BOSTON THAT YOU DON T GET IN THE BERKSHIRES THE NEVER GET TO THE WESTERN PART THE STATE NOT SURE THE WAR CAN EVER BE WON AT ANY COST BUT THAT NOT TO SAY THE WAR SHOULD BE ABANDONED COMPLETELY THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT SHOULD BEGIN TO REALLOCATE SOME OF ITS RESOURCES FROM STRICT ENFORCEMENT TO EDUCATION .. IF WE TO ULTIMATELY WIN THIS WAR WE TO TAKE AWAY THE PROFIT SINCE WE CANNOT OR HAVE NOT YET BEEN ABLE TO STEM THE SUPPLY WE TO CURTAIL THE MARKET EDUCATION PLAYS A GREAT ROLE IN CURTAILING THE MARKET BY MAKING PROGRAMS AND MONIES AVAILABLE TO LOCAL EDUCATIONAL SYSTEMS THE LONG RUN GOAL MAY BE ACHIEVED IN THIS FASHION AT THE SAME TIME THERE HAS TO BE CONTINUED LAW ENFORCEMENT EMPHASIS ON PUNISHMENT OF THOSE PEOPLE WHO ARE IN THE BUSINESS SELLING DRUGS O
