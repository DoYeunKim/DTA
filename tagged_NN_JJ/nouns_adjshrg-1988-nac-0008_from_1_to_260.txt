CENTER THE COLLEGE OF PHYSICIANS AND SURGEONS COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY MR CHAIRMAN PLEASE LET ME OFFER MY MOST SINCERE GRATITUDE FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO ADDRESS THIS ISSUE FROM THE VANTAGE POINT A PRIMARY HEALTH CARE PROVIDER FEW HOSPITALS CAN PROFESS A GREATER EXPERIENCE THAN HARLEM HOSPITAL WITH MEETING THE CHALLENGES OF ILLICIT OR LICIT PSYCHOTROPHIC DRUG USE BECAUSE HARLEM HOSPITAL S LONG LEGACY OF COMMUNITY SERVICE TO ITS LARGELY ECONOMICALLY DISENFRANCHISED COMMUNITY IT IS ESPECIALLY IMPORTANT WE SHARE WITH YOU AND THE OTHER MEMBERS THE SELECT COMMITTEE OUR PARTICULAR EXPERIENCES WHILE DRUG ABUSE KNOWS NO COLOR RACIAL SEXUAL OR ECONOMIC BARRIERS ITS PREVALENCE IN THE HARLEM COMMUNITY IS GREAT THE IMPACT OF DRUG ABUSE THE CITIZENS OF HARLEM REPRESENTS WITHOUT QUESTION A MAJOR PUBLIC HEALTH PROBLEM t DISCUSSIONS THE LEGALIZATION OF ONE OR MORE THE PRESENTLY ILLICIT DRUGS ARE STIMULATED AT LEAST IN PART BY TWO RELATED FACTS MOUNTING EVIDENCE THE CURRENT RESPONSE THE AMERICAN SOCIETY TO DRUG ABUSE HAS BEEN SHAMEFULLY INADEQUATE THE SECOND THE HYPOTHESIS THAT LEGALIZATION REPRESENTS A REASONABLE ALTERNATIVE TO THE CURRENT AMERICAN RESPONSE TO DRUG ADDICTION LIKE TO ADDRESS THESE FACTS SEPARATELY TO LIMIT HT REMARKS TO PUBLIC HEALTH OR MEDICAL CARE ISSUES NOT BECAUSE THET ARE NECESSARILY THE HOST CRITICAL AREAS FOR CONSIDERATION BY THIS HEARING PROCESS BUT RATHER BECAUSE THERE ARE MANY OTHER INDIVIDUALS AND PERSONS OF VARIOUS LEVELS OF EXPERTISE WHO ARE ARGUABLY MORE VERSED IN THE SOCIAL ECONOMIC AND CRIMINAL IMPLICATIONS OF DRUG ABUSE THE PUBLIC HEALTH PERSPECTIVE CAN MEASURE THE EFFECTIVENESS THE AMERICAN POLICIES DIRECTED AT DRUG ABUSE BASED THE PREVALENCE OF CONSUMPTION THESE PSYCHOTROPHIC SUBSTANCES AND / OR THE PREVALENCE OF DISEASE AND DEATH DUE TO THE USE THESE AGENTS WE DO NOT TRULY KNOW THE EXTENT OF USE THESE SUBSTANCES CURRENT DATABASES TO ASCERTAIN THE PREVALENCE OF DRUG ABUSE ARE EITHER BIASED BY VIRTUE OF THEIR SELECTION METHODOLOGY OR SO ATROPHIED DUE TO INADEQUATE MAINTENANCE SO TO COMPROMISE THE RESULTS THAT MAY BE DERIVED FROM THEM FOR EXAMPLE ANNOUNCEMENTS THE PREVALENCE OF DRUG ABUSE BASED UPON SURVEYS CONDUCTED AMONG HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS NOT BE TRULY REPRESENTATIVE AS TO WHAT IS OCCURRING AMONG ADOLESCENTS WHEN IN SOME URBAN CENTERS HIGH SCHOOL DROPOUTS WHO ARE NOT SURVEYED MAY BE THE MOST PRONED TO USE ILLEGAL OR LEGAL DRUGS EVEN SO IT CAN HARDLY BE SAID THE UNITED IS MAKING MAJOR GAINS IN RESPONSE TO DRUG ABUSE WHEN ONE PSYCHOTROPHIC IS BEING MERELY REPLACED BY ANOTHER IF WERE ON THE OTHER HAND TO LOOK AT THE PREVALENCE OF SCIENTIFICALLY DOCUMENTED MEDICAL CONSEQUENCES OF DRUG ADDICTION A GAGE THIS SOCIETY S RESPONSE THE UNEQUIVOCAL CONCLUSION WOULD REMAIN AMERICAN POLICY TO ADDRESS DRUG ABUSE A FAILED POLICY AS MEDICAL PROVIDERS AT HARLEM HOSPITAL WE CONTINUOUS PARADE PATIENTS ADMITTED FOR SUCH DRUG RELATED CONSEQUENCES AS CANCER HEART DISEASE PNEUMONIA AND MENINGITIS SIGNIFICANTLY LARGE NUMBER THE PATIENTS WITH KIDNEY FAILURE NEEDING DIALYSIS A HAPLEM HOSPITAL HAVE AN UNDERLYING DIAGNOSIS OF DRUG ABUSE THE CAUSE OF THEIR KIDNEY DISEASE IF THESE EXAMPLES OF DISEASE AND ILLNESS HERE NOT ENCUWl THE LATE SEVENTIES HAS IN WHAT IS PRESENTLY ONE OF THIS NATION S HOST PRESSING PUBLIC HEALTH PROBLEM THE ACQUIRED IMMUNODEFICIENCY SYNDROME AND OTHER MANIFESTATIONS OF INFECTION WITH THE HUMAN IMMUNODEFICIENCY VIRUS HIV ). MANY THESE MEDICAL COMPLICATIONS OF DRUG ABUSE HAVE SERIOUS MEDICAL IMPLICATIONS EVEN FOR THOSE OF US WHO DO NOT USE THESE PSYCHOTROPHIC SUBSTANCES FOR EXAMPLE THE SCIENTIFIC LITERATURE ADEQUATELY DOCUMENTS A GREATER RISK OF TUBERCULOSIS AMONG THE DRUG ADDICTED THAN AMONG THE GENERAL POPULATION A NUMBER OF REASONS BECAUSE TUPERCULOSIS INFECTION DOES NOT REQUIRE INTIMATE CONTACT IT NOT SURPRISING TO FIND THAT MANY COMMUNITIES WITH A HIGH PREVALENCE OF TUBERCULOSIS ALSO A CONSIDERABLE PREVALENCE OF DRUG ABUSE AIDS REPRESENTS ANOTHER EXAMPLE OF HOW DRUG ABUSE HAS AN IMPACT BEYOND THE PERSON USING THE ILLICIT SUBSTANCES WHILE INTRAVENOUS IV DRUG USE REPRESENTS ONLY THE SECOND MOST FREQUENT BEHAVIOR ASSOCIATED AIDS CASES REPORTED TO THE FOR DISEASE CONTROL IV DRUG USE MOST CRITICAL FACTOR RESPONSIBLE THE PREVALENCE OF AIDS AND HIV DISEASE AMONG ETHNIC / RACIAL MINORITIES WOMEN AND CHILDREN POIGNANTLY THE PERSONS WITH AIDS ACQUIRED BY HETEROSEXUAL TRANSMISSION FULLY SEVENTY PERCENT ADMIT THAT THEIR SEX PARTNER USED IV DRUGS WHILE KT TESTXHONT THUS FAR SUPPORTS FULLT THE PREMISE THAT FEDERAL DRUG POLICY IS INADEQUATELY RESPONSIVE PREPARED TO SUPPORT LEGALIZATION A MORE EFFECTIVE OPTION TO THE CONTRARY LEGALIZATION IN MY OPINION DOES NOT CONFRONT THE REASONS WHY THE UNITED IS UNSUCCESSFUL IN RESPONDING TO DRUG ABUSE PLEASE ALLOW ME TO ENUMERATE SOME THESE REASONS AN HEALTH CARE PROVIDER AT HOW WE NATION CAN RECONCILE THE INDIRECT SUBSIDY OF TOBACCO THE LEADING CAUSE OF DRUG RELATED MORBIDITY AND MORTALITY AND YET EXPECT OUR YOUTH TO BE RESPONSIVE TO OUR " SAY NO * CAMPAIGNS THE STIGMA ATTACHED TO DRUG ABUSE OR TO THOSE WHO USE DRUGS HAMPERS OUR UNDERSTANDING OF THIS MEDICAL DISORDER AND OUR RESPONSE IN NEW YORK STATE AND MANY OTHER IN THIS NATION THE STATE DRUG ABUSE AUTHORITY RESIDES OUTSIDE THE STATE PUBLIC HEALTH AUTHORITY IF DRUG ABUSE IS NOTHING ELSE IT A MAJOR PUBLIC HEALTH PROBLEM THAT SHOULD BE APPROPRIATELY CONSIDERED IN THE DEVELOPING PUBLIC HEALTH INITIATIVES AND IN DETERMINING HEALTH STATUS AND NEEDS THE FEDERAL LEVEL FRAGMENTATION IN EFFORT ALSO HINDERS THE INCLUSION OF DRUG ABUSE IN THE DETERMINATION OF HEALTH STATUS INDICATORS OR IN DETERMINING HEALTH MANPOWER NEEDS THE PAUCITY OF NATIONAL HEALTH SERVICE CORPS ASSIGNMENTS FOR PHYSICIANS IN NEW YORK CITY IS REPRESENTATIVE THE LACK OF INSIGHT AS TO THE CONTINUING AND INCREASING IMPACT OF DRUG ABUSE IN THIS GEOGRAPHIC LOCATION MANPOWER CONSIDERATIONS ARE UNFORTUNATELY NOT THE ONLY AREA OF HEALTH THAT CRIES FOR A MORE APPROPRIATE FEDERAL RESPONSE PHYSICIAN PERFORMING HOSPITAL WARD ATTENDING FUNCTIONS DURING THIS MONTH IT MOST DISTURBING TO NOT BE ABLE TO PROVIDE INTENSIVE CARE SERVICES TO PATIENTS IN NEED SORELY BASED ON THE FACT THE NUNBER OF HOSPITAL BEDS AVAILABLE ARE A LIHITED FEU NOT COMPREHEND HOW ANY PUBLIC HEALTH AUTHORITY IF IT TRULY CONSIDERED THE PREVALENCE AND MORBIDITY ASSOCIATED WITH DRUG ABUSE CAN ALLOW SUCH A STATE OF AFFAIRS TO CONTINUE TO EXIST IT IS ALSO UNCLEAR TO WHY THERE NOT GREATER EMPHASIS ON PRIMARY MEDICAL CARE THE ADDICTED ON SITE AT DRUG TREATMENT CLINICS THIS WOULD BE A PERFECT OPPORTUNITY TO PROVIDE PREVENTATIVE SERVICES TO A POPULATION THAT NOT TRADITIONALLY PROVIDED THESE SERVICES IN THE TYPICAL MEDICAL SETTINGS FOR A NUHBER OF REASONS LEGALIZATION NOT GOING TO ERASE THE FOREGOING PROBLEMS IN FACT IF WE LEARN ANYTHING THE PROHIBITION ERA AND THE ENGLISH HEROIN EXPERIENCE EPIDEMIOLOGIC EVIDENCE POINTS THAT MEDICAL CONSEQUENCES SECONDARY TO ALCOHOLISM SUCH CIRRHOSIS ACTUALLY DECREASED THE MEDICAL CONSEQUENCES OF DRUG ADDICTION INCREASED IN ENGLAND DURING THE YEARS WHEN HEROIN WAS LEGALLY AVAILABLE GIVEN THE HARLEM HOSPITAL EXPERIENCE WHERE THE MEDICAL CONSEQUENCES THE USE THESE SUBSTANCES OCCURS AT A DISPROPORTIONATELY GREATER RATE HY RESPONSE TO DRUG LEGALIZATION WOULD NECESSITATE AN EMPHATIC NO SAY TO IS A RECIPE FOR THIS COUNTRY THAT THE FOLLOWING THIS COUNTRY MUST DEVELOP POLICY THAT CONSIDERS DRUG ABUSE IN THE SAME VEIN IT CONSIDERS OTHER MAJOR HEALTH PROBLEMS SUCH AS DIABETES HEART DISEASE OR HYPERTENSION THIS ENCOURAGEMENT OF HEALTH PROFESSIONAL SCHOOLS TO INCLUDE DRUG ADDICTION IN THEIR
