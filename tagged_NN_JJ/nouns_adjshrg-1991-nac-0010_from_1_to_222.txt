Vacco Htprimtnt irjf | astitt STATEMENT OP DENNIS C VACCO UNITED STATES ATTORNEY NE8TERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK THE SELECT COMMITTEE ON NARCOTICS ABUSE AND CONTROL UNITED HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES BUFFALO / NEW YORK JULY MR CHAIRMAN LIKE TO THANK THE COMMITTEE FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO TESTIFY THIS MORNING THE DRUG PROBLEM IN THE WESTERN NEW YORK AREA AND WHAT LAW ENFORCEMENT AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL IS DOING TO ADDRESS THE PROBLEM YOUR PRESENCE HERE SIGNIFIES THE DRUG CRISIS IN THIS COMMUNITY NO LESS SEVERE THAN OTHER MAJOR POPULATION CENTERS THE COUNTRY INDEED PROBLEM IN WESTERN NEW YORK IS AGGRAVATED BY OUR LOCATION ON THE U S .— CANADIAN BORDER THE OPENNESS OUR BORDER WITH CANADA CERTAINLY CREATES MANY ADVANTAGES TO BE BY RESIDENTS ON BOTH SIDES THE NIAGARA RIVER UNFORTUNATELY THAT SAME OPENNESS HAS IT EASIER THE DRUG TRAFFICKERS TO MOVE NARCOTICS AND MONEY IN BOTH DIRECTIONS THE BORDER THE MAGNITUDE THE PROBLEM CAN BE MEASURED IN MANY WAYS BUT IN MY OPINION THE MOST TELLING FACTOR INCREASE OF VIOLENT STREET CRIME ASSOCIATED WITH THE LEVEL OF DRUG TRAFFICKING IN THIS AREA THROUGH MY PERSPECTIVE A LIFETIME PROSECUTOR FIRST IN THE ERIE COUNTY DISTRICT ATTORNEY S OFFICE FOR YEARS AND SINCE THEN THE U S ATTORNEY BEEN ABLE TO WITNESS FIRST HAND A SIGNIFICANT INCREASE IN DRUG TRAFFICKING DISTURBING ESCALATION OF VIOLENCE WHICH HAS ACCOMPANIED THE DRUG TRAFFICKING FOR EXAMPLE DRIVE BY SHOOTINGS IN THE CITY OF BUFFALO FOR THE FIRST THREE MONTHS THE YEAR HAVE ALREADY EXCEEDED THE TOTAL NUMBER OF DRIVE BY INCIDENTS IN ALL CHART A REVIEW OF CRIME STATISTICS IN THE WESTERN NEW YORK AREA INDICATES THE TWO MAJOR CITIES WITHIN THE WESTERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK HAVE EACH EXPERIENCED A SIGNIFICANT INCREASE IN VIOLENT CRIME FROM TO IN CITY OF BUFFALO THERE HAS BEEN A FORTY PERCENT INCREASE IN VIOLENT CRIME THE PERIOD TO CITY OF ROCHESTER WHICH IS LOCATED IN MONROE COUNTY HAS THE DUBIOUS HONOR OF HAVING THE HIGHEST PER CAPITA MURDER RATE IN THE STATE OF NEW YORK PROBLEMS IN BUFFALO AND ROCHESTER ARE GREATER IN NUMBER THE OUTLYING CITIES TOWNS AND VILLAGES IN THIS DISTRICT ARE ALSO SEEING SIGNIFICANT INCREASES IN DRUG TRAFFICKING AND VIOLENT CRIME U S CANADIAN BORDER PRESENTS AN OPPORTUNITY FOR THE DRUG TRAFFICKERS AND MONEY LAUNDERERS FOUR BORDER CROSSINGS IN THIS DISTRICT ALLOW FOR MILLIONS TO TRAVERSE THE BORDER YEARLY THE OPENNESS THE SHORES AND AIR SPACE ON BOTH SIDES THE BORDER FURTHER ENHANCE ACCESSIBILITY ARE LITERALLY THOUSANDS OF BAYS INLETS AND PRIVATE AIRSTRIPS FOR DRUG TRAFFICKERS TO SAFELY SMUGGLE DRUGS AND OR MONEY INTO OR OUT THE COUNTRY TO ILLUSTRATE THIS ACCESSIBILITY YOUR ATTENTION TO AN UNEXPLAINED DEATH A COLUMBIAN NATIONAL ON THE RUNWAY A RURAL AIRSTRIP WITNESSES OBSERVED A SMALL AIRCRAFT LAND AT NIGHT AT A SMALL AIRSTRIP IN OLEAN NEW YORK THE BENEFIT OF LIGHTS AFTER SHORT PERIOD THE GROUND THE AIRCRAFT WAS OBSERVED DEPARTING BUT AFTER A CALL WAS BY AN UNKNOWN INDIVIDUAL ADVISING THE NEW YORK STATE POLICE THAT THERE HAD BEEN AN ACCIDENT AT THE AIRPORT UPON ARRIVAL THE AUTHORITIES DISCOVERED THE BODY A MALE WHO HAD SUFFERED A SEVERE HEAD INJURY APPARENTLY CAUSED BY A PROPELLER EVIDENCE THE AIRSTRIP REVEALED THE DECEASED HAD COMMENCED HIS TRIP IN TORONTO ADDITIONAL EVIDENCE INDICATED THAT PRIOR TO DEPARTING TORONTO HE WAS IN THE COMPANY OF AN INDIVIDUAL WHO IS KNOWN BY CANADIAN AUTHORITIES A DRUG TRAFFICKER WE MAY NEVER KNOW WHAT HAPPENED THAT NIGHT ON THE REMOTE AIRSTRIP BUT THE FACT REMAINS THAT WHOEVER WAS THE AIRCRAFT PURPOSE IN MIND FOR HIS UNAUTHORIZED LANDING AT A REMOTE AIRSTRIP TANGIBLE EVIDENCE THE MAGNITUDE OF DRUG TRAFFICKING CAN BE OBSERVED IN THE TYPES AND QUANTITIES OF NARCOTICS SEIZED THE AMOUNT OF ASSETS FORFEITED AT THE BORDER CHART HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS HAVE BEEN SEIZED AND FORFEITED IN EACH THE LAST THREE FISCAL YEARS IN THIS DISTRICT HE HAVE SHARED FORFEITED ASSETS OF OVER NINE MILLION DOLLARS WITH MORE THAN STATE AND LOCAL AGENCIES SINCE FURTHER SINCE MONEY LAUNDERING PROSECUTIONS HAVE DRAMATICALLY INCREASED IN THIRTY PERCENT THE CRIMINAL DOCKET IN THIS DISTRICT WAS CONSUMED BY NARCOTIC OR RELATED PROSECUTIONS SAME YEAR OVER FORTY SIX PERCENT THE DEFENDANTS WERE CHARGED WITH NARCOTIC RELATED OFFENSES PLEASED TO REPORT THAT MANY THESE PROSECUTIONS HAVE TARGETED MAJOR TRAFFICKING ORGANIZATIONS AND PEOPLE WITH INTERNATIONAL CONNECTIONS THE NUMBER OF ORGANIZED CRIME DRUG ENFORCEMENT TASK FORCE CASES IN THIS DISTRICT ARE NEARLY MANY THE SAME TYPE OF CASES IN OTHER DISTRICTS IN THEIR RESPECTIVE DIVISIONS OUR EFFORTS IN MONEY LAUNDERING ARE BEST UNDERSCORED BY THE RECENT INDICTMENT A FORMER ASSISTANT UNITED ATTORNEY WHO WAS IN CONTROL A BANK ACCOUNT IN HONG KONG VALUED IN EXCESS OF THREE MILLION DOLLARS YOU CAN SEE IN THE WESTERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK WE HAVE APPROACHED THE PROBLEM IN A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT WAYS OUR DISTRICT CONTINUES TO INCREASE ITS COMMITMENT OF RESOURCES TO THE INVESTIGATION AND PROSECUTION OF DRUG CASES THE DRUG DIVISION IN MY OFFICE WORKS CLOSELY WITH THE STATE PROSECUTORS IN THE DISTRICT ESPECIALLY IN RELATION TO MAJOR TRAFFICKING GROUPS IN ADDITION WE ARE COMMITTED TO ASSISTING THE LOCAL PROSECUTORS IN ADDRESSING THE VIOLENT STREET CRIME WHICH IS RELATED TO NARCOTIC TRAFFICKING IN THIS REGARD THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE HAS INSTITUTED SEVERAL PROGRAMS THAT HAVE ALREADY AND WILL CONTINUE TO GO A

JULY GOOD MORNING MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE IT PLEASURE TO APPEAR YOU TODAY TO REPORT ON THE COAST GUARD S VIEW OF DRUG TRAFFICKING ON THE CANADA / UNITED BORDER AND OUR EFFORTS TO DEAL WITH THE PROBLEM THIS HEARING IS UNCLASSIFIED YOUR UNDERSTANDING THAT SOME SPECIFICS OF LAW ENFORCEMENT METHODS RESOURCES AND SOURCES OF INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION MUST NECESSARILY BE OMITTED TO PROTECT THE INTEGRITY OF OPERATIONS AMD THE SAFETY OF CONTRIBUTING PERSONNEL YOU NOTE TERM " CANADA / UNITED BORDER " INSTEAD OF " NORTHERN BORDER ." IN ORDER TO BETTER UNDERSTAND THE DRUG TRAFFICKING PROBLEM IT IS IMPORTANT TO RECOGNIZE THE LONGEST UNGUARDED BORDER IN THE WORLD IS NOT A ONE WAY DOOR WHEN IT COMES TO SMUGGLING CANADA S " SOUTHERN BORDER " IS AS MUCH A CONCERN TO THEM OUR " NORTHERN BORDER " IS TO US WHEN DISCUSSING DRUG TRAFFICKING AND OTHER FORMS OF ILLEGAL CROSS BORDER ACTIVITY FROM ALASKA TO MAINE FROM THE BAY OF FUNDY TO THE BEAUFORT SEA THIS AMICABLE AND PERMEABLE LINE BETWEEN THE TWO COUNTRIES HAS POSED UNIOUE CHALLENGES TO LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES CAPABILITIES IN FIGHTING SMUGGLING ON BOTH SIDES THE BORDER FOR HUNDREDS OF YEARS Ill IN THE INTEREST OF TIME NOT REHASH THE SEIZURE DATA AND OTHER STATISTICS MY COLLEAGUES HAVE SO CLEARLY PRESENTED HERE TODAY IT THE BEST DATA AVAILABLE BUT THEREIN THE PROBLEM THERE A DEFINITE PAUCITY OF INFORMATION CONCERNING SMUGGLING ACROSS THE CANADA / UNITED BORDER OF US AGREE THERE IS DRUG SMUGGLING GOING ON NONE OF US CAN BEGIN TO DESCRIBE THE TRUE DIMENSIONS THE PROBLEM BECAUSE NONE OF US HAS THE RESOURCES TO MONITOR A VIRTUALLY UNPATROLLED BORDER MORE THAN MILES LONG YOU AND HEAR FROM OTHERS TODAY SMUGGLERS USE EVERY CONCEIVABLE METHOD AND FORM OF CONVEYANCE TO TRANSPORT THEIR ILLEGAL CARGO ARE MANY EYES AND EARS IN THE NATIONAL INTELLIGENCE AND LAW ENFORCEMENT COMMUNITIES FOCUSED ON OUR SOUTHWEST AND SOUTHEAST BORDERS FEW ARE TURNED NORTH TO DETERMINE WHAT HAPPENING HERE IN SPITE THIS INFORMATION VACUUM LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES HAVE TRIED TO DO SOMETHING THE COAST GUARD HAS JOINED WITH U S CUSTOMS CANADIAN CUSTOMS U S BORDER PATROL THE FEDERAL AVIATION ADMINISTRATION THE NATIONAL GUARD AND OTHER FEDERAL STATE AND LOCAL AGENCIES ON BOTH SIDES THE BORDER TO CONDUCT FORMAL MANPOWER INTENSIVE " DRAGNET TYPE " ENFORCEMENT OPERATIONS ALTHOUGH THEY WERE PATTERNED AFTER SIMILAR ONES IN THE SOUTHEAST AND SOUTHWEST U S THESE OPERATIONS ON THE NORTHERN BORDER HAVE YIELDED NO TANGIBLE RESULTS THIS DUE IN LARGE PART TO THE SCARCITY OF ACCURATE AND SPECIFIC INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION ON SMUGGLING ACROSS THE CANADA / U S BORDER SIMPLY PUT WE DID WHAT WE COULD WITH THE INFORMATION WE HAD FURTHER WE THE SAME TYPES OF PROBLEMS AS EXPERIENCED ELSEWHERE IN PROTECTING SUCH AN OPERATION FROM PREMATURE DISCLOSURE WHEN DEALING WITH SCORES OF PEOPLE FROM A HALF DOZEN AGENCIES AND TRYING TO COORDINATE EFFORTS WEEKS AHEAD OF TIME ON NON SECURE TELEPHONE LINES ALSO BECAUSE THE SIZE THESE OPERATIONS THE VERY PRESENCE THE LARGE NUMBER OF RESOURCES INVOLVED THE EXISTENCE OF EACH OPERATION WAS COMPROMISED ON THE FIRST DAY OF EXECUTION FINALLY UNTIL RECENTLY THERE WAS NO MECHANISM TO PREVENT NEIGHBORING JURISDICTIONS FROM CONDUCTING CONFLICTING OPERATIONS IN THE SAME GENERAL VICINITY MANY US IN THE LAW ENFORCEMENT COMMUNITY HAVE COME TO THE CONCLUSION WE MUST " WORK SMARTER " IF WE TO BEAT THE SMUGGLER ON HIS OWN CHOSEN GROUND WE MUST ABANDON THE " DRAGNET TYPE " OPERATIONS INSTEAD FOCUS ON A SPECIFIC TARGET KNOWN SMUGGLER A SMUGGLING GROUP OR A FREQUENTLY USED SMUGGLING ROUTE OR LOCATION THEN MOUNT A COORDINATED MULTI AGENCY EFFORT AGAINST THAT TARGET THAT MANY OF US FEEL THE ONLY WAY TO ATTACK THE PROBLEM MAIN WEAPON IN THIS ATTACK AND THE KEY TO ITS SUCCESS IS INTELLIGENCE THIS BEEN SHOWN REPEATEDLY ON THE SOUTHWEST AND SOUTHEAST BORDERS WITHOUT ACCURATE INTELLIGENCE LAW ENFORCEMENT EFFORTS ARE HIT AND MISS AND NOT COST EFFECTIVE ACCURATE SPECIFIC INTELLIGENCE WILL RESULT IN MORE PRODUCTIVE USE OUR RESOURCES AND HAVE GREATER IMPACT THE DRUG TRAFFICKING HERE THERE ARE SOME INTELLIGENCE DATABASES ALONG THE BORDER RIGHT NOW THERE NO SHORTAGE OF INTELLIGENCE COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS OPPORTUNITIES MANY STATE AND LOCAL DEPARTMENTS AS WELL REGIONAL OR DISTRICT OFFICES THE FEDERAL AGENCIES COMPILE DATA ON PARTICULAR SMUGGLERS SMUGGLING GROUPS LOCATIONS AND METHODS IS NEEDED IS COORDINATION ANALYSIS AND ACCESS TO INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION OF FOR AND BY LAW ENFORCEMENT AND SUPPORTING AGENCIES ON BOTH SIDES THE BORDER WE NEED TO COMBINE IN A CENTRAL LOCATION ALL THE INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION FROM THESE EXISTING DATABASES THEN IT COULD BE ACCESSED COMPARED AND THOROUGHLY ANALYZED COORDINATED PICTURE WOULD BE MUCH CLOSER TO REAL LIFE THAN ANYTHING WE HAVE NOW COAST GUARD AND MANY OTHERS BELIEVE THAT PROJECT NORTH STAR IS THE BEST PROSPECT FOR MEETING THESE NEEDS NOT TAKE YOUR TIME WITH AN INDEPTH DESCRIPTION OF PROJECT NORTH STAR CHIEF PATROL AGENT RON CARNES THE DIRECTOR OF ENFORCEMENT THE PROJECT WILL DO THAT LATER THIS MORNING INSTEAD OUTLINE THE COAST GUARD S EFFORTS IN SUPPORT OF NORTH STAR THE COAST GUARD IS AN ACTIVE PARTICIPANT IN PROJECT NORTH STAR YOU MAY KNOW NORTH STAR HAS DIVIDED THE CANADA / U S BORDER INTO THREE REGIONS SIMILAR GEOGRAPHY AND THREAT EAST CENTRAL AND WEST WITH MULTI AGENCY JOINT COORDINATING GROUPS OR JCG ’ S FORMED TO FACILITATE THE EFFORTS IN EACH REGION AND ALONG THE ENTIRE BORDER COAST GUARD HAS PERMANENT REPRESENTATIVES ON THE BORDER WIDE JCG THE CENTRAL REGION JCG AND IS IN THE PROCESS OF DESIGNATING REPRESENTATIVES TO THE EAST AND WEST REGIONS CENTRAL REGION WHICH ENCOMPASSES THE ENTIRE GREAT LAKES INCLUDES THE LARGEST PART THE COAST GUARD S EFFORT ALONG THE CANADA / U S BORDER WE ARE ALSO ACTIVE IN BOTH THE PACIFIC AND ATLANTIC MARITIME ZONES ABUTTING THE EAST AND WEST REGIONS THE COAST GUARD REPRESENTATIVE TO THE CENTRAL REGION WAS APPOINTED THE CHAIRMAN OF THAT REGION ’ S MARINE INTERDICTION COMMITTEE AND ALSO CO INTELLIGENCE SUBCOMMITTEE OF THAT GROUP IN THIS DUAL CAPACITY THE COAST GUARD REPRESENTATIVE IS WORKING TOWARD THE GOAL THE CONSOLIDATED ACCESSIBLE DATABASE DESCRIBED PREVIOUSLY CONTINUING TO FOCUS ON OUR EFFORTS IN THE CENTRAL REGION A MOMENT THE COAST GUARD THE ONLY U S AGENCY WITH A REGIONAL OFFICE WHICH THE ENTIRE CENTRAL REGION THE NINTH COAST GUARD DISTRICT HEADQUARTERED IN CLEVELAND OHIO IS RESPONSIBLE ALL COAST GUARD LAW ENFORCEMENT OPERATIONS ON THE GREAT LAKES AND IMMEDIATE TRIBUTARIES THAT OFFICE MAINTAINS A FULL TIME INTELLIGENCE STAFF WITH DATABASES ON COMMERCIAL AND PLEASURE VESSELS AND SMUGGLING INDIVIDUALS AND GROUPS THE OFFICE DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY LIAISONS WITH FEDERAL STATE AND LOCAL AGENCIES ON BOTH SIDES THE BORDER AN EXAMPLE OF THIS THE LOCK REPORTS THE NINTH DISTRICT RECEIVES FROM THE ST LAWRENCE SEAWAY THE REPORTS TELL US THE COMMERCIAL VESSELS WHICH HAVE ENTERED OR WILL ENTER THE GREAT LAKES AND THEIR EXPECTED PORTS OF CALL IN THE UNITED AND CANADA THE NINTH DISTRICT OFFICE CHECKS THE LIST OF INBOUND VESSELS AGAINST AVAILABLE DATABASES AND NOTIFIES APPROPRIATE CANADIAN AND U S S AUTHORITIES WHEN SUSPECTED DRUG SMUGGLING VESSELS ARE DESTINED FOR THEIR PORTS JOINT COAST GUARD / CUSTOMS BOARDINGS ARE ARRANGED FOR VESSELS OF SIGNIFICANT INTEREST ALSO NINTH COAST GUARD DISTRICT UNITS HAVE VERY CLOSE RELATIONS WITH THEIR CANADIAN AMERICAN LAW ENFORCEMENT COUNTERPARTS IN THEIR LOCAL AREAS OF RESPONSIBILITY AND ROUTINELY COORDINATE THEIR EFFORTS NOT ONLY AGAINST DRUG TRAFFICKERS BUT IN MANY OTHER AREAS OF MUTUAL INTEREST SUCK AS SEARCH AND RESCUE MARINE ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AND ICEBREAKING OPERATIONS FINALLY THE COAST GUARD A FULL PARTICIPANT IN AN ORGANIZED CRIME DRUG ENFORCEMENT TASK FORCE IN CLEVELAND SPONSORED BY THE U S ATTORNEY THE NORTHERN DISTRICT OF OHIO IN CONCLUSION MR CHAIRMAN THE COAST GUARD DOES NOT SEEK ANY ADDITIONAL RESOURCES TO SUPPORT OUR DRUG INTERDICTION EFFORTS THE CANADA / U S BORDER INSTEAD WE PLEDGE TO CONTINUE OUR EFFORTS TO " WORK SMARTER ", THAT TO MAKE MORE EFFICIENT USE OUR EXISTING RESOURCES IN THE WAR ON DRUGS WE FURTHER PLEDGE OUR SUPPORT FOR PROJECT NORTH STAR THE PRIMARY FOCAL POINT FOR CONSOLIDATING AND COORDINATING THE LAW ENFORCEMENT AND INTELLIGENCE GATHERING AND ANALYSIS EFFORTS OF CANADIAN
