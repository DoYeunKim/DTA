Amityville NY THANK YOU THE OPPORTUNITY TO TESTIFY THIS MORNING SHEILA B BLUME M D ., C A C ., MEDICAL DIRECTOR OF ALCOHOLISM CHEMICAL DEPENDENCY AND COMPULSIVE GAMBLING PROGRAMS AT SOUTH OAKS HOSPITAL IN AMITYVILLE NEW YORK CLINICAL PROFESSOR OF PSYCHIATRY AT THE STATE UNIVERSITY OF NEW YORK AT STONY BROOK AND DIRECTOR THE SOUTH OAKS INSTITUTE OF ALCOHOLISM AND ADDICTIVE BEHAVIOR STUDIES BEEN ACTIVE IN THE FIELD OF ALCOHOLISM FOR YEARS AND SERVE ON THE BOARDS THE DIRECTORS THE AMERICAN SOCIETY OF ADDICTION MEDICINE THE CHILDREN ALCOHOLICS FOUNDATION AND THE NATIONAL COUNCIL ON ALCOHOLISM AND DRUG DEPENDENCE ALSO CHAIRMAN THE PUBLIC POLICY COMMITTEE THE AMERICAN SOCIETY OF ADDICTION MEDICINE HOWEVER TODAY SPEAK FOR MYSELF ALTHOUGH THE CRACK EPIDEMIC AND COCAINE AFFECTED BABIES HAVE DRAWN A GREAT DEAL OF RECENT MEDIA ATTENTION WE MUST NOT FORGET WE STILL A HORRENDOUS DRUG DEPENDENCE PROBLEM IN WOMEN IN THIS COUNTRY WHICH INVOLVES TWO LEGAL DRUGS ALCOHOL OUR NATION S FAVORITE DRUG NUMBER ONE IN BOTH USE AND ABUSE AND NICOTINE OUR SECOND FAVORITE BOTH THESE DRUGS AFFECT THE GROWTH AND DEVELOPMENT THE FETUS THE FETAL ALCOHOL SYNDROME REMAINS ONE THE TOP THREE CAUSES OF MENTAL RETARDATION DUE TO BIRTH DEFECT IN AMERICA AND THE ONLY ONE OF THESE THREE CAUSES THAT COMPLETELY PREVENTABLE CIGARETTE SMOKING DURING PREGNANCY HAS BEEN SHOWN TO CAUSE DECREASED BIRTH WEIGHT IN INFANTS ATTACH SOME MATERIALS ABOUT WOMEN AND NICOTINE DEPENDENCE TO THIS TESTIMONY BUT WILL CONCENTRATE THIS MORNING ON ALCOHOL WOMEN ARB MORE SENSITIVE TO ALCOHOL THAN MEN YEARS WE HAVE NOTICED THE DISEASE OF ALCOHOLISM PROGRESSES MORE RAPIDLY IN WOMEN THAT WOMEN DEVELOP THE LATE STAGE COMPLICATIONS THE DISEASE FASTER AND WITH A LOWER ALCOHOL INTAKE WHEN COMPARED TO MEN WE KNEW THE LIGHTER WEIGHT AND LOWER WATER CONTENT IN WOMEN S BODIES MEANS THE ALCOHOL THEY CONSUME BE LESS DILUTED BUT NEW EVIDENCE HAS NOW COME TO t LIGHT THAT SHOWS US THAT WOMEN ALSO ABSORB MORE OP THE ALCOHOL THEY DRINK COMPARED TO MEN NORMAL WOMEN HAVE SIGNIFICANTLY LESS AN ENZYME THAT BREAKS DOWN ALCOHOL IN THEIR STOMACHS ALCOHOLIC WOMEN HAVE ESSENTIALLY NONE THIS ENZYME AND SO THEY ABSORB EVEN MORB PUT THIS ALL TOGETHER AND THB RESULT IS A STANDARD DRINK AN ALCOHOLIC BEVERAGE A SHOT OF LIQUOR A CAN OF BEER A GLASS OF WINE HAVE FAR MORB DESTRUCTIVE EFFECT IN A WOMAN THAN MAN ADD TO THAT THE FACT THAT ALCOHOL ENTERS EVERY CELL THE HUMAN BODY AND EASILY CROSSES THE PLACENTA TO ENTER EVERY CELL THE DEVELOPING FETUS AND THE STAGE IS SET FOR HUMAN TRAGEDY ALCOHOL PROBLEMS IN WOMEN CUT ACROSS ALL ETHNIC AND SOCIOECONOMIC GROUPS FOR EXAMPLE ANDREA HALLIDAY AND HER COLLEAGUES AT HARVARD FOUND % MIDDLE CLASS WOMEN CHILDBEARING AGE WHO WENT FOR ROUTINE GYNECOLOGICAL CARE WERE ALCOHOLICS STUDY AT JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY HOSPITAL WHICH INCLUDED MANY DISADVANTAGED PATIENTS FOUND A RATE OF ALCOHOL ABUSE % IN BOTH OBSTETRICS AND IN GYNECOLOGY INPATIENTS URGENT IMPORTANCE OF SYSTEMATIC SCREENING AND REFERRAL FOR ALCOHOL PROBLEMS IN OBSTETRIC PRACTICE AS WELL ALL OTHER MEDICAL CARE ). UNFORTUNATELY THIS NOT COMMONLY DONE AT PRESENT TRENDS IN ALCOHOL USE THE NATION A WHOLE HAVE BEEN TOWARD A LOWER PER CAPITA CONSUMPTION ). HOWEVER WE DERIVE ANY FEELING OF SECURITY FROM THIS TREND WE SHOULD ALSO NOTE THE OVERALL DECREASE HAS BEEN COMBINED WITH AN INCREASE IN HEAVY DRINKING AMONG YOUNG ADULTS BOTH MALE AND FEMALE ). FOR WOMEN THIS AGAIN MEANS THOSE CHILDBEARING AGE THE NEED TO EDUCATE OUR YOUNG WOMEN ABOUT THEIR SENSITIVITY TO ALCOHOL IS URGENT YOUNG BULK OF THEIR KNOWLEDGE ABOUT ALCOHOL FROM ONE EVER PRESENT SOURCE ADVERTISING THE AGES OF AND THE AVERAGE AMERICAN CHILD SEES SOMETHING LIKE BEER COMMERCIALS ). IN RECENT YEARS THE ALCOHOLIC BEVERAGE INDUSTRY HAS TARGETED WOMEN A GROWTH MARKET ), YET VERY LITTLE TARGETED PREVENTION WORK ZS BEING DONE WITH GIRLS OR YOUNG WOMEN THE " WOMAN TO WOMAN " PROGRAM THE ASSOCIATION OF JUNIOR LEAGUES AND THE PROGRAMS THE NATIONAL COUNCIL ON ALCOHOLISM AND DRUG DEPENDENCE ARE AMONG THE VERY FEW IN TERMS OF COMPARATIVE RESOURCES WE ARE ROWING THE MIGHTY MISSISSIPPI RIVER IN A DINGHY HERB PLACE THE CONGRESS CAN REALLY HELP WOMEN DEVELOP ALCOHOLISM HAVE PARTICULAR PROBLEMS WHICH DIFFER FROM MEN S THEY A VERY SPECIAL SOCIETAL STIGMA NOT ONLY ARB THEY LOOKED DOWN UPON AS FAILURES BUT THIS SOCIETY ALSO MAINTAINS A DEEPLY HELD STEREOTYPE DATING BACK TO THE ANCIENT ROMANS AND ISRAELITES THAT WOMEN WHO DRINK ARE PROMISCUOUS ). THIS STEREOTYPE WOMEN WHO DRINK ARE CONSIDERED ACCEPTABLE TARGETS OF SEXUAL ABUSE IN AMERICAN SOCIETY FOR EXAMPLE A STUDY OF RAPE SHOWED THAT SOCIETY FINDS A RAPIST WHO IS INTOXICATED TO BE LESS RESPONSIBLE THE RAPE A VICTIM WHO IS INTOXICATED IS CONSIDERED MORE TO BLAME ). THERE AN ENTIRE BODY OF RESEARCH ON SEXUAL ABUSE AND VICTIMIZATION AS BOTH A PRECURSOR RESULT WOMEN S ALCOHOLISM AND DRUG DEPENDENCE TODAY WE ARE FACED WITH YET ANOTHER FORM OF VICTIMIZATION OF ALCOHOL AND DRUG DEPENDENT WOMEN THAT CRIMINAL PROSECUTION THESE SICK WOMEN FOR SO CALLED " PRENATAL CHILD ABUSE ," OR FOR DELIVERING CONTROLLED SUBSTANCES TO A MINOR THE UMBILICAL CORD SUBSTITUTION OF CRIMINAL PROSECUTION FOR PREVENTION AND TREATMENT IS AN UNCONSCIONABLE PUBLIC POLICY WE LOOK TO CONGRESS FOR HELP IN REVERSING THIS TREND SEE ATTACHED ). BOTH STIGMA AND VICTIMIZATION ADD TO THE FORMIDABLE BARRIERS ALREADY FACING CHEMICALLY DEPENDENT WOMEN WHO SEEK TREATMENT WE TEND TO SPEAK OF " CHEMICAL DEPENDENCY " BECAUSE THE VERY COMMON CO OCCURRENCE ALCOHOL AND OTHER DRUG DEPENDENCE IN WOMEN FOREMOST BARRIERS IN ADDITION TO STIGMA ARE THE LACK OF CHILD CARE AND INADEQUATE INSURANCE COVERAGE HERE AGAIN WE LOOK TO THE CONGRESS FOR HELP SINCERELY THESE HEARINGS WILL FOCUS THE ATTENTION OF THIS COMMITTEE THE CONGRESS AND THE AMERICAN PEOPLE ON URGENT AND THE IMPORTANT WORK THAT TO BE DONE IN THE PREVENTION AND TREATMENT OF CHEMICAL DEPENDENCY IN WOMEN WE ALREADY FALLEN BEHIND PLEASE HELP US CATCH UP ATTACHED SOME REFERENCE MATERIALS A BIBLIOGRAPHY TO THIS TESTIMONY ).
