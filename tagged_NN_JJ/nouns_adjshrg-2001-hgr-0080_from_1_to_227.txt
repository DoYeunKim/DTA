CONCERNS ABOUT THE METHAMPHETAMINE EPIDEMIC IN OUR COMMUNITY IN WAS PRIVILEGED TO BE ASKED BY SHERIFF DUKES TO BEGIN WORK THE FIRST UNDERCOVER NARCOTICS OFFICER THE HISTORY OF OUR SMALL DEPARTMENT HAVING WORKED FOR SEVERAL YEARS A STREET COP GOOD GRASP THE DRUG TRAFFIC AND USE IN OUR COUNTY THE BIG WERE IN FORT WAYNE DETROIT AND CHICAGO AND THAT THE LOCAL DEALERS PICKED UP THEIR DOPE FROM THEM TO SALE IN YOUR COUNTY WE HAD LSD MARIJUANA AND COCAINE IN OUR COMMUNITY METHAMPHETAMINE WAS MAINLY THE TRUCKERS AND BIKERS OUT THE COURSE THE NEXT HAVE A CLUE THE SCOPE THE DRUG PROBLEM IN NOBLE COUNTY INDIANA MY FIRS !' EXPOSURE TO METH WAS IN WHEN A DEPUTY STOPPED A YUGO ON A TRAFFIC VIOLATION THE YUGO AN OVERWHELMING ODOR COMING THE VEHICLE THE CAR A PLASTIC GAS TANK IN THE BACK THAT HOSE AITACHED TO IT THAT WAS VENTED OUT THE REAR THE VEHICLE THE TANK WAS FROSTED OVER AND BULGING AT THE SEAMS THE DEPUTY KNEW THAT SOMETHING WAS AMISS BUT REALLY DID NOT KNOW HOW TO PROCEED SO HE DID WHAT HE BEEN TRAINED TO DO HE THE VEHICLE IMPOUNDED AND TAKEN TO THE PARKING LOT THE SHERIFFS DEPARTMENT THE THREE OCCUPANTS WERE TAKEN INTO CUSTODY AS WELL IMAGINE IF YOU WILL HOW STUPID WE ALL FELT WE WATCHED TIIE CHEMICAL TEAM FROM INDIANAPOLIS APPROACH Tins VEHICLE IN HEAD TO TOE PROTECTIVE GEAR INCLUDING BREATHING APPARATUS TO DETERMINE WHAT THE WERE FORTUNATELY THE PROCESS AT THIS POINT WAS DEEMED TO BE NONTOXIC THIS LEARNING EXPERIENCE COULD HAVE ENDED TRAGICALLY IF THE CHEMICAL PROCESS HAD BEEN IN A MORE ADVANCED STAGE SHOCKED WE PROCESSED THE CAR AND DOCUMENTED WHAT CHEMICALS WERE BEING USED TO MANUFACTURE METH COLEMAN FUEL LITHIUM BATTERIES BRAKE FLUID AND RED DEVIL LYE DURING MY TENURE WORKING NARCOTICS APPROXIMATELY % THE DRUG CASES THAT SALE AND MANUFACTURE OF METHAMPHETAMINE CLAN LABS STARTED APPEARING THROUGHOUT NORTHERN INDIANA NOT MAJOR LABS THAT ARE COMMON IN THE SOUTHWEST BUT PRIMARILY “ MOM AND POP ” LABS COURSE THE NEXT SEVERAL MONTHS WE ARRESTED ONE NOBLE COUNTY RESIDENT IN NOBLE COUNTY WITH OF METH LEARNING LATER WE MISSED ANOTHER ANOTHER LOCAL RESIDENT WAS INTERDICTED IN KANSAS WITH OVER OF METH WHICH HE PURCHASED IN CALIFORNIA THE INTERESTING THING ABOUT BOTH THESE ARRESTS THE METH SHIPMENTS WERE NOT GOING TO THE BIGGER CITIES BUT WERE COMING DIRECTLY TO NOBLE COUNTY WHEN YOU CONSIDERED THE AVERAGE PRICE A POUND OF METH IS WE KNEW WE WERE DEALING WITH MAJOR IN TERMS OF DRUG TRAFFICKERS IN ANOTHER INSTANCE A FEMALE RESIDENT WAS ARRESTED AFTER RECEIVING FED EX PACKAGES CONTAINING METH FORM CALIFORNIA SHE SUBSEQUENTLY WAS CONVICTED SERVED HER TIME WAS RELEASED AND ARRESTED AGAIN FOR MANUFACTURING METH IN HER APARTMENT REVIEWED SEVERAL PUBLICATIONS TO PREPARE FOR THIS PRESENTATION THE REOCCURRING THEME THAT METH PROBLEM PROPENSITY THAT USERS HAVE TOWARDS VIOLENCE OUR COUNTY IS NO EXCEPTION TO THIS RULE IN WE ARRESTED A FEMALE FOR DEALING METH AND COCAINE FROM HER HOME A SEARCH WARRANT WAS CONDUCTED HER HOUSE WE DISCOVERED SEVERAL SEMI AUTOMATIC ASSAULT RIFLES A SAWED OFF SHOTGUN AND A BULLETPROOF VEST LATER IN SEARCH WARRANTS WERE CONDUCTED ON TWO SEPARATE LOCATIONS IN NOBLE COUNTY ON A HISPANIC DEALER WHO REPORTEDLY HAD TIES TO THE MEXICAN MAFIA THE SUSPECT WAS NOT LOCATED HOWEVER SEVERAL GUNS WERE CALIBER DESERT EAGLE THE SUSPECT WAS LATER SHOT AND KILLED IN MEXICO REPORTEDLY A DRUG DEBT HE OWED IN WHILE SEARCH WARRANT ON A SUSPECTED METH DEALER THE SUSPECT ATTEMPTED TO SHOOT OFFICERS WITH A HANDGUN OFFICERS RETURNED FIRE AND KILLED THE SUSPECT AN AUTOPSY CONDUCTED ON THE SUSPECT REVEALED THE SUSPECT HAD TOXIC LEVELS OF METHAMPHETAMINE IN HIS SYSTEM IN YEAR ANOTHER SEARCH WARRANT WAS CONDUCTED IN NEIGHBORING LAGRANGE COUNTY AND THE SUSPECT SET HIS HOUSE ON FIRE AND THEN SHOT AT POLICE OFFICERS WHO RETURNED FIRE KILLING THE SUSPECT RECENTLY SEARCH WARRANT WAS CONDUCTED ON A CLAN LAB IN OUR COUNTY AND A DECEASED INFANT WAS FOUND IN A DUFFEL BAG TIIE MOTHER THE CHILD A YEAR OLD JUVENILE ADMITTED SHE REGULAR USER OF METH AND WAS USING METH DURING HER PREGNANCY SHE HER CHILD WAS STILLBORN AND SHE HAD CARRIED THE CHILD IN THE DUFFEL BAG FOR SEVERAL WEEKS COUNTRY VIOLENCE HAS INCREASED A DIRECT RESULT OF METH USAGE AND IT WILL CONTINUE TO ESCALATE AS METH BECOMES MORE AND MORE POPULAR LAST NIGHT IN NOBLE COUNTY DEPUTIES ARRESTED A PERSON WITH GRAMS OF METH OR YEARS AGO THIS WOULD BE A MAJOR NEWS STORY FOR US TODAY IT MAKES THE FRONT PAGE IN MY LIFETIME DON T BELIEVE THAT RURAL AMERICA HAS EVER HAD TO DEAL WITH ANYTHING AS DESTRUCTIVE AND COSTLY AS METH IT DESTROYING COMMINUTES MORALLY SPIRITUALLY
