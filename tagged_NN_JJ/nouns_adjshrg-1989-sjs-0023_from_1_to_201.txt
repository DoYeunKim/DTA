ST **~ SAT Y l £ i6 */ rYy D £ C Statc SENATOR BIDEN SENATOR THURMOND DISTINGUISHED QUESTS LADIES AND GENTLEMEN IT A PRIVILEGE AND AN HONOR FOR ME TO TESTIFY AT THIS HEARING TODAY BEEN INVOLVED IN THE DRUG ENFORCEMENT FIELD FOR OVER SIGHT OF MY FIFTEEN YEARS OF SERVICE WITH THE DELAWARE STATE POLICE UNDERCOVER DOING BOTH SHORT AND LONG TERM INVESTIGATIONS ALSO HAD THE OPPORTUNITY TO SUPERVISE MANY OTHER OFFICERS WITH THEIR UNDERCOVER INVESTIGATIONS AND A RESULT MANY CHANGES SINCE THE BACK THEN THE DIFFICULTY WAS THE RAPPORT NECESSARY A DRUG DEALER TO BE CONVINCED IT WAS SAFE TO DEAL WITH AND SELL DRUGS TO A STRANGER .,.. AN UNDERCOVER POLICE OFP1CER NOW LITERALLY ANYBODY CAN BUY DRUGS REGARDLESS OF THEIR APPEARANCE THE ONLY RAPPORT NECESSARY IS INSTANTLY DEVELOPED WHEN THE DEALER SEES YOUR CASH FEAR GETTING CAUGHT BY LAW ENFORCEMENT HAS BEEN OVERTAKEN BY SHEER AVARICE THE ADMINISTRATIONS OF POLICE AGENCIES IN GENERAL FELT THE DRUG PROBLEM COULD BE DEALT WITH JUST BY STEPPING UP THE NUMBERS OF ARRESTS THAT WERE MADE WE VE LEARNED THAT KIND A PAPER WORK SOLUTION DOESN T WORK WHAT DOES WORK IS AN EFFORT TO COMBAT THE PROBLEM NOT ONLY AT THE LOWEST ECHELON WHERE THE EASIEST AND MOST ARRESTS CAN BE BUT AT THE UPPER LEVELS AS WELL WE WERE TO CONCENTRATE OUR EFFORTS ONLY ON THE STREETS WE WOULD BE GIVING CARTE BLANCHE TO THE UPPER LEVEL TRAFFICKERS THE REVERSE IS ALSO TRUE WERE WE TO FOCUS ONLY AT THE UPPER LEVELS THERE ALSO ARE ALL THOSE INTERMEDIARIES THAT MUST BE PURSUED THIS APPROACH WHAT WE BEEN TRYING TO DO IN RURAL KENT AND SUSSEX COUNTIES AND THIS JUST AS TRUE FOR NEW CASTLE COUNTY AS WELL YEARS CERTAIN DRUGS HAVE COME AND GONE IN TERMS OF AVAILABILITY AND POPULARITY WE VE WITNESSED A FLOOD OF MARIJUANA AT ONE TIME HEROIN WAS IN VOGUE A WHILE AMPHETAMINES AND BARBITURATES HAD THERE HEY DAY WE VE BEEN THROUGH METHAMPHETAMINES L S D ., P C P ., DESIGNER DRUGS AND OTHERS COCAINE HAS BEEN AROUND A LONG TIME AS DESTRUCTIVE IT CAN BE WE HAVE NEVER SEEN ANYTHING DEVASTATING TO OUR COMMUNITY AS CRACK COCAINE CRACK CAME TO OUR ATTENTION HERE IN EARLY TO BEST OUR KNOWLEDGE IT WAS INTRODUCED TO THE AREA BY HAITIAN IMMIGRANTS WITH TIES TO FLORIDA WHERE THE LAROEST COMMUNITY OF HAITIANS HAD SETTLED CRIMINAL OPPORTUNISTS WITHIN THE HAITIAN COMMUNITY HAP A READY SUPPLY OF COCAINE FROM FLORIDA AND CRACK CONVERSION A SAFE AND SIMPLE PROCESS SNORTED THE MUCOUS MEMBRANES COCAINE IS ABSORBED INTO THE BLOOD STREAM AND GOES TO THE BRAIN WHERE THE HIGH IS PRODUCED SMOKED IN THE FORM OF CRACK OR ROCK IT GOES TO THE LUNGS WHERE THE ABSORPTION IS MUCH MORE RAPID AND THE HIGH IS SIGNIFICANTLY MORE INTENSE FOR THOSE INCLINED TO ESCAPE REALITY THROUGH DRUG USE THE POTENTIAL FOR REPEATED USE AND ADDICTION IS IS ALSO MUCH GREATER THE UNPREDICTABLE AND SOMETIMES VIOLENT BEHAVIOR THE CRACK USER HAS BEEN DEMONSTRATED MANY TIMES NOT ONLY IN THE DEPRESSED AREAS OP SOME THE NATIONS LARGEST CITIES BUT ALSO RIGHT HERE IN RURAL DELAWARE AFTER SHORT PERIOD OF CRACK S PRESENCE LOCALLY OUR DETECTIVES NOTICED PROPERTY CRIMES ON THE RISE IN THERE WERE SIX MURDERS IN SUSSEX COUNTY THAT WERE ATTRIBUTABLE TO CRACK THE CRACK PROBLEM MAKES VICTIMS THE INNOCENT AND NOT SO INNOCENT ALIKE THE HAITIAN WHO BEGAN TO SET UP SHOP IN THE AREA TRIED TO DO SO QUIETLY IN ORDER TO AVOID NOTICE DETECTION AND ARREST DEMAND BY THE USERS FOR THIS OVERWHELMINGLY POPULAR FORM OF COCAINE CAUSED THE PROBLEMS WITH SECURITY CROWDS AND EVEN TRAFFIC CONGESTION OUR SURVEILLANCE PROVED TO US THE HAD SECURITY IN MIND BUT THE VOLUME OF CUSTOMERS AND THE GREED TO MAKE MONEY OVERCAME THEIR DESIRE TO BE CAUTIOUS OPEN AIR STREET DEALING BECAME PREVALENT IN SEVERAL AREAS OF DELAWARE AND F VEN AFTER REPEATED ARRESTS AND STREET SWEEPS SOME CONTINUE TO FLOURISH THE NEW CRACK PROBLEM WAS IDENTIFIED LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES HAD TO RE THEIR METHODS ATTACKING THE DRUG DEALERS IN THIS CASE WE WERE DEALING WITH A PEOPLE WHO WERE FOR ALL INTENT AND PURPOSES REFUGEES FROM AN OPPRESSIVE NATION WHERE THERE WAS NO BILL OF RIGHTS OR CONSTITUTIONAL PROTECTIONS THE CRIMINAL ELEMENT THESE PEOPLE ARE VERY CAUTIOUS OF POLICE UNLIKE THE TYPICAL STREET CORNER ADDITIONALLY THERE LANGUAGE BARRIER WHEN WE MANAGE TO MAKE A CASE AGAINST THESE THEY ARE ALMOST INSTANTLY REPLACED BY ANOTHER SOMEWHERE ELSE ON DELMARVA BETWEEN DELAWARE AND MARYLAND AUTHORITIES WE HAVE REMOVED OVER THESE TRAFFICKERS WHO JUST HAPPENED TO BE HAITIANS WE LL GET ONE IN THE SEAFORD AREA THE NEXT WILL SURFACE IN Hl ’ RLOCK MD THE MARYLAND STATE POLICE WILL GET THE GUY IN HURLOCK AND A NEW ONE WILL SHOW UP IN GEORGETOWN FOR YEARS NOW WE BEEN OETTING THE
