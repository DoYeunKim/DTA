THINGS HAVE ONLY GOTTEN WORSE IN THE FIRST FOUR MONTHS THERE HAVE BEEN HOMICIDES IN THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA AND SO THOSE DEATHS WERE RELATED TO DRUGS THESE FIGURES SHOW THAT TIME IS RUNNING OUT AND WE HAVE TO DO THAN JUST BUY A LITTLE MORE TIME LAST WEEK AT A SUBCOMMITTEE HEARING MY SUGGESTIONS FOR SOMETHINGS WE CAN DO LATER TODAY THOSE SUGGESTIONS BE INTRODUCED IN THE FORM OF LEGISLATION LEGISLATION WOULD BOLSTER POLICE MANPOWER AND EFFORTS BY ALLOWING CROSS DEPUTIZATION THIS WOULD ENABLE POLICE TO FOCUS MORE ATTENTION ON THOSE MID LEVEL CONDUCT THEIR BUSINESS IN D C THEN GO HOME TO SLEEP PEACEFULLY IN PRINCE GEORGE ’ S COUNTY OR ARLINGTON ARE PLENTY OF NEIGHBORHOODS IN D C BEEN TAKEN OVER BY DRUG DEALERS MY BILL WOULD GIVE POLICE MORE CONTROL BY ALLOWING THEM TO TEMPORARILY BLOCKADE AND RESTRICT MOVEMENT WTIHIN ANY AREA THAT RECENT MULTIPLE DRUG ARRESTS THIS WOULD GIVE LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS A TOOL WITH WHICH TO BREAK UP OPEN AIR DRUG MARKETS AND RETURN OUR NEIGHBORHOODS TO THEIR LAW ABIDING CITIZENS MY BILL WOULD ALLOW POLICE TO USE STUN GUNS A NON LETHAL ELECTRONIC DEVICE WHEN ARRESTING ADDICTS WHO ARE COMPLETELY OUT OF CONTROL SOME THESE DRUGS LIKE PCP — CREATE PHYSICAL AND PSYCHOLOGICAL REACTIONS SO BIZARRE THAT THE POLICE AND THE ABUSER ARE IN DANGER THEY BOTH NEED HUMANE PROTECTION MY BILL ALSO RECOGNIZES THAT THERE THRIVING MARKET FOR DRUGS IN OUR AREA THE POLICE EVEN THE U S DRUG ENFORCEMENT AGENCY HAVE TOLD US SOMETHING MUST BE DONE ABOUT THE DEMAND FOR DRUGS LONG PEOPLE WANT DRUGS SOMEONE BE THERE TO SUPPLY THEM WE NEED BETTER EDUCATION AND TREATMENT PROGRAMS ESPECIALLY IN THE JUVENILE AND ADULT CORRECTIONAL CENTERS DRUGS ARE EASILY AVAILABLE THROUGHOUT THE D C PRISON SYSTEM THIS SUBCOMMITTEE WAS TOLD THE INMATES TEST POSITIVE A VARIETY OF ILLEGAL SUBSTANCES IF THIS DRUG EPIDEMIC CAN T BE CONTROLLED IN A CLOSED INSTITUTION THEN THERE IS LITTLE HOPE CONTROLLING IT OUT ON THE STREETS DRUGS ARE AVAILABLE BECAUSE CORRECTIONS ADMINISTRATORS DO LITTLE TO STOP DRUGS FROM COMING INSIDE THROUGH STAFF AND VISITORS THEY DON ’ T PROVIDE MUCH IN THE WAY OF TREATMENT RESULT ADDICTS CONVICTED FOR DRUG RELATED CRIMES NEVER GET FREE OF DRUGS EVENTUALLY THEY OUT GO RIGHT BACK TO USING AND PUSHING DRUGS THIS AN ENDLESS CYCLE IGNORE VE ASKED FOR AND WAS PROMISED A HEARING ON WHAT WE CAN DO ABOUT CONTROLLING THE DEMAND FOR DRUGS WE MUST STOP THE MARKET FOR DRUGS IN THE WASHINGTON AREA AND WE WILL FOCUS ON THAT ON JUNE WE GOING TO REALLY FIGHT THIS BATTLE WE ALL KNOW YOU TO ATTACK THE ENEMY ON EVERY FRONT TO NEED

EXECUTIVE SIDNEY KRAMER MONTGOMERY COUNTY MARYLAND APRIL AMERICA IS CURRENTLY UNDER SIEGE THE ENEMY WITHOUT AND WITHIN IS ILLICIT DRUGS THE MENACE OF DRUGS A NATIONAL STATE AND LOCAL ISSUE REQUIRING THE EFFORTS AND RESOURCES OF PUBLIC AND PRIVATE SECTORS WE NATION UNDER SIEGE AND WE MUST MOBILIZE ALL OUR PEOPLE AND COMMUNITIES TO COMBAT THIS MENACE JUST THIS GREAT NATION CAME INTO BEING BECAUSE A SPIRIT OF UNITY AND COMMON CAUSE JUST A GREAT REVOLUTION FOR FREEDOM FROM TYRANNY WAS BORN ON THE GREEN FIELDS OF LEXINGTON AND CONCORD A SIMILAR REVOLUTION AGAINST THE TYRANNY OF ILLICIT DRUGS MUST COME AGAIN THE COLLECTIVE COMMUNITIES THIS GREAT LAND WHERE THROUGH PREVENTION EFFORTS OUR PEOPLE LEARN THE WISDOM TO SAY NO TO DRUGS TO THE LAW ENFORCEMENT EFFORTS TO MAKE DRUG DEALING AND USE A HIGH RISK VENTURE TO TREATMENT PROGRAMS WHICH PROVIDE A ROAD BACK TO THE MAINSTREAM AMERICAN SOCIETY FOR OUR AFFLICTED TOGETHER WITH THESE LOCAL INITIATIVES WE A NEED AS NEVER BEFORE FOR NATIONAL LEADERSHIP WHICH WILL SEAL OUR BOARDERS FROM ILLICIT DRUG TRAFFICKING AS LOCAL GOVERNMENTS WE CAN PREVENT THE GROWTH OR MANUFACTURE MOST DRUGS BUT WE MUST LOOK TO THE NATIONAL GOVERNMENT TO INTERDICT THE MASSIVE INFLUX OF ILLEGAL DRUGS WHICH CROSS OUR NATIONAL AND STATE BOARDERS AND INFILTRATE OUR COMMUNITIES CORRUPT OUR YOUTH ENSLAVES OUR PEOPLE ATTACKS THE VERY SPIRIT AND WILL OF THE AMERICAN PEOPLE FORMENTS VIOLENCE AND TEARS AT THE VERY FABRIC OF AMERICA IN BRIEF WE NEED TO IDENTIFY ILLICIT DRUG TRAFFICKING AND USE THE EVIL IT IS AND EXERT STRONG NATIONAL AND LOCAL LEADERSHIP TO MOBILIZE ALL OF OUR PEOPLE TO C0M8AT THIS MENACE TO OUR FREE SOCIETY OUR COMMUNITIES OUR NEIGHBORHOODS AND OUR FAMILIES THE COWITTEE HAS REQUESTED THAT OUR REMARKS BE FOCUSED ON ELEVEN PARTICULAR AREAS OF INQUIRY AS SET FORTH IN YOUR LETTER MARCH INTERJURISDICTIONAL DRUG TRAFFICKING INTRAJURISDICTION DISTRIBUTION AND USE OF ILLEGAL DRUGS COMBINED MONTGOMERY COUNTY BEING A PART THE WASHINGTON D C METROPOLITAN AREA SHARES THE SAME DRUG PROBLEMS THAT OUR NEIGHBORS EXPERIENCE DRUG NOT RESPECT AND IN MOST CASES ARE NOT EYEN AWARE OF JURISDICTIONAL BOUNDARIES THERE NO DRUG UNIQUE TO MONTGOMERY COUNTY OR TO MY KNOWLEDGE ANY OTHER NEIGHBORING JURISDICTION THE TWO POSSIBLE EXCEPTIONS ARE PHENCYCLIDINE PCP AND HEROIN INVESTIGATORS IN MONTGOMERY COUNTY HAVE LEARNED THAT FOR THE MOST PART PURCHASES OF WHOLESALE QUANTITIES THESE TWO DRUGS ARE USUALLY MADE IN WASHINGTON D C PCP UNIQUE TO THIS COUNTRY IS USUALLY MADE BY CLANDESTINE CHEMISTS IN CALIFORNIA AND SHIPPED TO WASHINGTON D C IN BULK HEROIN ON THE OTHER HAND HAS INTERNATIONAL IMPLICATIONS BUT IN ANY EVENT IT ENDS UP IN WASHINGTON D C IN BULK FROM SOURCE CITIES AND COUNTRIES ONLY AT THE LOWEST LEVELS A DRUG DISTRIBUTION NETWORK CAN OUR DRUG PROBLEM BE CONSIDERED INTRAJURISDICTIONAL OF COURSE EVEN AT THAT IT MUST BE REALIZED THAT MOST INSTANCES THOSE DRUGS ORIGINATED SOMEWHERE ELSE THEY ENDED UP ON THE STREETS OF MONTGOMERY COUNTY CONCERNING MONTGOMERY COUNTY S USER POPULATION WE FIND THAT GENERALLY OUR PROBLEMS MIRROR OUR NEIGHBORS WE TEND HOWEVER TO HAVE FEWER HEROIN ADDICTS HERE THAN PERHAPS WASHINGTON D C OR PRINCE GEORGE S COUNTY BUT PROBABLY MORE LSD ABUSERS COULD BE IN OUR COMMUNITY THAN AMONG OUR NEIGHBORS COCAINE OUR BIGGEST PROBLEM PAST SIX MONTHS CRACK COCAINE HAS EMERGED AND LIKE WHAT S HAPPENING TO OUR NEIGHBORS IS SPREADING IN POPULARITY RAPIDLY THE RESULTS RELEASED RECENTLY THE RAND STUDY CONCERNING PCP ABUSE IS INDISPUTABLE THIS INCREDIBLY DANGEROUS DRUG REMAINS VERY POPULAR AMONG MANY OF OUR DRUG USING POPULATION INTEROURISOICTIONAL TRANSPORTATION OF SEMIAUTOMATIC AND AUTOMATIC WEAPONS AND THEIR USE BY THE ILLEGAL DRUG DISTRIBUTION COMMUNITY GUNS CARRIED BY DRUG ARE NOT A NEW PHENOMENON THEY AN IMPORTANT TOOL THE TRADE DRUG HAVE ALWAYS FELT THEY NEEDED GUNS TO PROTECT THEIR DRUG SUPPLY THE MONEY GAINED FROM SALES IT QUITE COMMON FOR DRUG TO BE ROBBED THEIR MONIES AND DRUGS AND OF COURSE THEY CANNOT REPORT THESE CRIMES OR ASK FOR POLICE PROTECTION DRUG INVESTIGATORS HOWEVER ARE NOTING A DISTURBING TREND WITH RESPECT TO GUNS FIRST MORE SOPHISTICATED WEAPONS INCLUDING FULLY AUTOMATIC ASSAULT RIFLES ARE APPEARING MORE FREQUENTLY SECONDLY THESE WEAPONS ARE BEGINNING TO BE USED MORE OFFENSIVELY THAN EVER BEFORE RANDOM SHOOTINGS FOR INTIMIDATION PURPOSES ARE NOW COMMON FURTHERMORE IT NOT UNUSUAL FOR A ■ ^ DRUG BUYER INCLUDING UNDERCOVER POLICE OFFICERS TO HAVE WEAPONS POINTED AT THEM DURING PURCHASES FINALLY THE ISSUE OF TURF WARS INVOLVING THE USE OF WEAPONS IS OCCURRING BECAUSE THE INFLUX OF JAMAICAN DRUG TRAFFICKERS AND NEW YORK CITY CRACK COCAINE THEIR WAY INTO OUR DRUG COmUNITIES IMPACT DRUG TRAFFICKING IN THE NATIONAL CAPITAL METROPOLITAN AREA ON CRIME AND DRUG RELATED VIOLENCE DRUGS CRIME ARE NEARLY SYNONYMOUS STUDY AFTER STUDY HAS PROVEN THE RELATIONSHIP THAT DRUGS HAVE ON CRIME OUR MONTGOMERY COUNTY STATISTICS SHOW CRIME INCREASING AROUND OUR KNOWN DRUG AREAS IT EASY TO UNDERSTAND HOW A HEROIN ADDICT MUST STEAL TO SUPPORT HIS HABIT IT IS COMMONLY KNOWN HOW STRONG A HEROIN ADDICTION BECOMES COMMONLY KNOWN HOWEVER THE FACT THAT COCAINE IS ADDICTIVE TOO MORE ADDICTIVE IN FACT THAN HEROIN DISTURBING ABOUT COCAINE S ADDICTION NATURE OF CRIMES A COCAINE ADDICT WILL TEND TO COMMIT HEROIN ADDICT WILL TURN TO NONCONFRONTATIONAL CRIMES SUCH SHOPLIFTING TO SUPPORT HIS HABIT A COCAINE ADDICT WILL TEND TO COMMIT MORE VIOLENT CRIMES SUCH ROBBERY PURSE SNATCHING AND BURGLARY THE RAPID EMERGENCE AND SPREAD OF CRACK IS CREATING EVER INCREASING NUMBERS OF COCAINE ADDICTS IN OUR COMMUNITY THIS OF COURSE AN ALARMING TREND EFFECTIVENESS OF LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES TO IMPACT THE DISTRIBUTION OF DRUGS THE LEVEL OF COOPERATION BETWEEN LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES AND THE LEVEL OF COOPERATION BETWEEN LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES AND FEDERAL LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICIALS • H HOW EFFECTIVE WE AT THE LOCAL LEVEL ARE CAN BE MEASURED IN A NUMBER OF WAYS WE SEEM TO BE HAVING LITTLE EFFECT ON THE AVAILABILITY OF COCAINE AND PCP IN SPITE OF RECORD SEIZURES BEING REPORTED BY ALL JURISDICTIONS WE ARE GRATEFUL AND PROUD THAT IN WE HERE IN MONTGOMERY COUNTY SEIZED IN EXCESS OF COCAINE COMPARED TO POUNDS THE PREVIOUS YEAR WE ARE EQUALLY GRATEFUL AND PROUD TO HAVE SEIZED NEARLY GALLONS OF PCP VALUED AT EIGHT MILLION DOLLARS JUST TWO WEEKS AGO ARRESTS FOR USE AND DISTRIBUTION ARE UP ALSO CERTAINLY ONE COULD POINT TO THOSE TRENDS AND CLAIM SUCCESS HOWEVER THE PAINFUL TRUTH WE ARE AWARE MOST ANYONE IS OUR DRUG PROBLEMS IS WORSENING WE ARE COOPERATING WITH NEIGHBORING AND FEDERAL AUTHORITIES MORE THAN EVER BEFORE THIS COOPERATION HAS LEO TO NUMEROUS SUCCESSFUL MULTIJURISDICTIONAL CASES WE CAN HONFSTLY STATE THAT THERE NOT ONE FEDERAL AGENCY OR NEIGHBORING JURISDICTION THAT NOT COOPERATE WITH US ON MATTERS OF MUTUAL CONCERN WE ARE CONSTANTLY LOOKING FOR WAYS TO MORE EFFICIENT PAST YEAR WE HAVE FULLY STAFFED OUR JUMP OUT SQUAD WITH TEN OFFICERS AND HAVE RECEIVED A FEDERAL GRANT TO FORM A NARCOTIC CONSPIRACY UNIT THE JUMP OUF ^ SQUAD TARGETS THE DEMAND SIOE OUR DRUG PROBLEM BY ARRESTING DRUG USERS AND STREET LEVEL DRUG DEALERS THE CONSPIRACY UNIT ON THE OTHER HAND WORKING WITH THE GRAND JURY AND PROSECUTORS TARGETS DRUG BROKERS AND THEIR ORGANIZATIONS THIS UNIT ATTEMPTS TO IDENTIFY AND ARREST THE TOP LEVEL DRUG DEALER MAY BE SO WELL INSULATED THEY NEVER TOUCH DRUGS THEMSELVES WITH THESE TWO NEW UNITS AND INCREASED COOPERATION AMONG FEDERAL AND NEIGHBORING JURISDICTIONS WE CAN CONFIDENTLY SAY WE ARE MAKING GREAT STRIDES IMPROVING OUR EFFECTIVENESS THE LONG LASTING ItPACT THESE EFFORTS HAVE REMAINS TO BE SEEN PRESENT STATUS THE PROSECUTORIAL AND JUDICIAL SYSTEMS TO COPE WITH THE ONSLAUGHT OF DRUG RELATED CASES OUR ATTORNEY S OFFICE HAS DECLARED WAR ON DRUGS HERE IN MONTGOMERY COUNTY THEY ALONG WITH THE POLICE DEPARTMENT HAVE DEDICATED THEMSELVES TO CREATE A HOSTILE ENVIRONMENT FOR THOSE WHO WOULD DISTRIBUTE OR USE DRUGS IN OUR COUNTY THE ATTORNEY S OFFICE HAS FORMED A DRUG PROSECUTOR TEAM HEADED BY A DEPUTY STATE S ATTORNEY THIS TEAM HANDLES ONLY DRUG CASES AND WORKS CLOSELY WITH THE POLICE DEPARTMENT S DRUG ENFORCEMENT UNITS THE ATTORNEY S OFFICE IS ALSO A PART OF OUR CONSPIRACY UNIT WITH A STATE S ATTORNEY AND THREE STATES ATTORNEY S OFFICE INVESTIGATORS PROBLEM ARISING CAPABILITY OF OUR COURTS AND CORRECTIONAL FACILITIES TO HANDLE THE EVER INCREASING NUMBERS OF DRUG DEFENDANTS WE FIND BOTH THE COURTS AND OUR CORRECTIONAL DEPARTMENT OPERATING AT BEYOND CAPACITY AND THEIR PROBLEMS ARE WORSENING CURRENT DRUG ABUSE TRENDS IN WASHINGTON D C THE SURROUNDING JURISDICTIONS THE ABILITY OF TREATMENT PROGRAMS TO MEET THE DEMAND FOR SERVICES DRUGS OF ABUSE THAT ARE PREVELANT IN THE MONTGOMERY COUNTY MARYLAND SUBURBS ARE COCAINE CRACK ), PCP AND MARIJUANA IT IS RARE ABUSERS ARE SINGLE SUBSTANCE USERS DRUG ARE POLY SUBSTANCE ABUSERS WITH THEIR DRUG ABUSE COMMONLY ASSOCIATED WITH ALCOHOL ABUSE AND ALCOHOLISM COCAINE ESPECIALLY CRACK COCAINE IS RAPIDLY BECOMING THE DRUG OF CHOICE HERE IN MONTGOMERY COUNTY AND WE BELIEVE IN OUR NEIGHBORING JURISDICTIONS THIS HIGHLY ADDICTIVE SMOKABLE FORM OF COCAINE IS NEW TO THIS AREA HAVING ONLY BEEN HERE THE PAST SIX MONTHS EXPERIENCED DRUG INVESTIGATORS REPORT HAVING NEVER SEEN A DRUG APPEAR AND SPREAD IN POPULARITY LIKE CRACK HAS DONE THIS THE NATIONAL TREND PCP CONTINUES TO BE POPULAR THIS POTENT ANIMAL TRANQUILIZER WHICH CAUSES BIZARRE AND SOMETIMES VIOLENT BEHAVIOR IS POPULAR ESPECIALLY AMONG LOW INCOME POPULATIONS INVESTIGATORS ARE WITNESSING CHRONIC PCP USERS SWITCHING TO CRACK INDICATING THAT CRACK MAY CAUSE A DECREASE IN THE POPULARITY OF PCP ALTHOUGH CRACK AND PCP ARE OUR TOP TWO DRUGS WE CONTINUE TO SEE WIDESPREAD USE OF MARIJUANA AND LSD TO A LESSER EXTENT FINALLY THE USE OF ALCOHOL BY TEENS IS WIDESPREAD AND CONTINUES TO ALARM US PRESENT AND PLANNED DRUG PREVENTION AND EDUCATION PROGRAMS WITHIN YOUR JURISDICTION PROBLEM OF DRUG AND ALCOHOL ABUSE A COMMUNITY PROBLEM COMMUNITY INCLUDES GOVERNMENT SCHOOLS CHURCHES BUSINESSES NEIGHBORHOODS AND FAMILIES SOLUTIONS OR APPROACHES TO SOLVE THE

HALFWAY HOUSE FOR SUBSTANCE ABUSING ADOLESCENTS AT THE PRESENT TIME MONTGOMERY COUNTY IS EXPERIENCING APPROXIMATELY FOUR WEEK WAIT FOR OUTPATIENT TREATMENT IF AN INCREASED ENFORCEMENT EFFORT CONTINUES IN DRUG ABUSE IT IS POSSIBLE THE TREATMENT PROGRAMS BE OVERWHELMED MOST THOSE ARRESTED ARE USERS IN NEED OF TREATMENT RECOMMENDATION ACTIONS AT THE FEDERAL STATE AND LOCAL LEVELS TO ADDRESS THE PROBLEMS OF DRUG TRAFFICKING AND ABUSE IN THE NATIONAL CAPITAL METROPOLITAN AREA THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT NEEDS TO SINCERELY ADDRESS THE PROBLEM OF DRUG INTERDICTION SOURCE COUNTRIES WHETHER THEY ARE OUR FRIENDS OR NOT NEED TO HAVE THE STRICTEST OF PRESSURES APPLIED WE AT THE LOCAL LEVEL BELIEVE THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT MUST RECOGNIZE THE TREMENDOUS IMPACT THAT DRUGS ARE HAVING ON OUR SOCIETY IT IS LITERALLY DESTROYING ENTIRE COMMUNITIES A LARGE SHARE OF OUR YOUNG PEOPLE WE AT THE LOCAL LEVEL RECOGNIZE THE THREAT AND ARE WILLING TO COMMIT THE APPROPRIATE RESOURCES TO EFFECTIVELY COMBAT THIS PROBLEM BETTER COORDINATION AMONG NEIGHBORING JURISDICTIONS AND FEDERAL AUTHORITIES IS AN AREA IN WHICH WE ARE CONSTANTLY STRIVING IN THAT REGARD THE WASHINGTON D C COUNCIL GOVERNMENTS WE NEED TO FORM A COLLECTIVE STRATEGY STRATEGY THAT DOESN T FOSTER COMPETITION BUT INSTEAD INSURES COOPERATION STRATEGY PROBLEM AND SETS OUT GOALS AND PERIODICALLY EVALUATES RESULTS AND SETS _NEW DIRECTIONS AND PRIORITIES ANY PRELIMINARY THOUGHTS YOU MAY HAVE ON THE WASHINGTON METROPOLITAN AREA DRUG AUTHORITY W M A D A .). AS WAS OUR POSITION TWO YEARS AGO WE THE NEED FOR A REGIONAL AUTHORITY IS UNNECESSARY PRESENTLY THERE EXISTS MUTUAL TASK FORCES OF FEDERAL AND LOCAL AGENTS ALONG WITH THE COOPERATIVE SPIRIT THE COUNCIL OF GOVERNMENTS NARCOTIC OFFICERS SUBCOMMITTEE THE C O G SUMMIT THE LEADERS IN THE DRUG FIGHT ON APRIL THE TYPE OF ACTION NEEDED IN OUR LOCAL FIGHT AGAINST DRUGS WE THE SPIRIT OF COOPERATION AND INVOLVEMENT BY THOSE INVOLVED IN THE WAR ON DRUGS THAT NOW BEING DISPLAYED HAVE ITS EVENTUAL IMPACT THE WAR ON DRUGS IS NOT A LOCAL PROBLEM OR EVEN A NATIONAL ONE BUT AN INTERNATIONAL ONE WHICH REQUIRES ALL TO WORK TOGETHER IN CLOSING TO OBSERVE THAT IN MY VIEW IT MOST APPROPRIATE THESE PROCEEDINGS ARE OCCURING DURING THE WEEK DECLARED " NATIONAL VICTIMS RIGHTS WEEK ." FOR WHEN IT COMES TO THE EVILS OF ILLICIT DRUG TRAFFICKING AND USE WE ARE ALL VICTIMS IT IS TIME FOR US TO COLLECTIVELY CHALLENGE THIS EVIL AND CERTAIN WITH YOUR HELP EACH AND EVERYONE OF US CAN AND
