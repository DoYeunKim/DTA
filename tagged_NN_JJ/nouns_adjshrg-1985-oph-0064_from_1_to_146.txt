HONOR AND OPPORTUNITY TO ADDRESS YOU MATTER OF MUTUAL CONCERN TO THE GOVERNMENT THE UNITED THE STATE OF FLORIDA FROM SINCE NOVEMBER VE HAVE EXPERIENCED AN ALARMING INCREASE IN THE DUMBER OF CLANDESTINE COCAINE LABS THAT ARE IN OPERATION IN THE SOUTHEASTERN COUNTIES THE STATE OF FLORIDA IT NOT MY INTENTION TO TAKE UP THIS COMMITTEE S TIME WITH STATISTICAL INFORMATION IT IS MY DESIRE TO PROVIDE YOU SOME BACKGROUND DATA WHICH WILL ACQUAINT YOU WITH AN HISTORICAL AND CHRONOLOGICAL PERSPECTIVE THE PROBLEM PUBLISHED REPORTS COMPILED BY THE FEDERAL DRUG ENFORCEMENT ADMINISTRATION DEA THE NATIONAL NARCOTICS BORDER INTERDICTION NNBIS THE FLORIDA DEPARTMENT OF LAW ENFORCEMENT FOLK THE METRO DAIS COUNTY ORGANIZED CRIME BUREAU OCB ), THE BROWARD COUNTY SHERIFFS DEPARTMENT ORGANIZED CRIME BUREAU BCOCB ), REVEAL THAT PERIODS NOVEMBER AND DECEMBER A SEVEN HUNDRED PERCENT INCREASE IN CONFIRMED CLANDESTINE COCAINE LABORATORIES HAVE BEEN DOCUMENTED IN DADE AND BROWARD COUNTIES TOTAL SIX INCIDENTS INVOLVING ClANDESTINE DOLING THE PERIOD OP JANUARY THROUGH NOVEMBER OP NUMBER OP CONFIRMED LABS HAS INCREASED TO FORTY FOUR AMD HORIZONTALLY SPREAD TO INCLUDE DADE BROWARD PALM BEACH AND COLLIER COUNTIES IT WOULD BE APPROPRIATE AT THIS TIKE TO DISCUSS IN SOME DETAIL THE BASIS FOR OUR PROBLEM IT APPEARS THAT FROM A POINT OP REFERENCE IT CAN BE TRACED TO LEGISLATION PASSED BY PRESIDENT BELISARIO BETANCOURT IN COLOMBIA SOUTH AMERICA WHICH CREATED A CAUSE * EFFECT RELATIONSHIP THAT PARTIALLY DISPLACED COCAINE PROCESSING FROM COLOMBIA TO SOUTH FLORIDA BASED ON INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION PROVIDED BY THE DRUG ENFORCEMENT ADMINISTRATION TO THE COLOMBIAN GOVERNMENT WHICH ESSENTIALLY THE VAST AVAILABILITY AND RELATIVE USE OF ETHER THE PRODUCTION OF COCAINE ), IN JANUARY PRESIDENT BETANCOURT PASSED LEGISLATION WHICH A SPECIAL PERMIT TO POSSESS ETHER ACETONE AND OTHER CHEMICALS CONSIDERED ESSENTIAL TO PRODUCE COCAINE THE RESULT WAS THAT YEAR NO PERMITS WERE ISSUED AMD THE SUPPLY BECAME DISPROPORTIONATE TO THE DEMAND IT HAS BEEN REPORTED THAT IN THE PRICE OP ETHER IN COLOMBIA INCREASED THAN FIVE FOLD SINCE PRICE OP ETHER HAS INCREASED FROM PER FIFTY FIVE GALLON DRUM TO DOLLARS COMBINATION THE OVERSUPPLY OF COCA BASE AND THE SCARCITY OP ETHER HAS RESULTED IN A PARTIAL SHIFT FROM COLOMBIAN BASED OPERATION TO FLORIDA BASED CLANDESTINE COCAINE LABORATORIES INTELLIGENCE ASSESSMENTS SUPPORT THE TJBOHY THAT THESE OPERATIONS CONTINUE TO BE FINANCED AMD MANAGED BY MAJOR COCAINE PROCESSING ORGANIZATIONS IN SOUTH AMERICA IT SHOULD BE NOTED HOWEVER THAT MAJORITY OP ARRESTEES ARE COLOMBIAN NATIONALS SOME ARE CUBAN NATIONALS AMD SOKE ARE ANGLOS THIS TRANSITION CAN BE CHARACTERIZED AN ECONOMIC PHENOMENON FOR VIOLATORS WITH TREMENDOUS SOCIAL IMPLICATIONS TO THE STATE OF FLORIDA HONORABLE OF CONGRESS IT IS ESSENTIAL FROM THIS POINT FORWARD VE FOCUS OUR ATTENTION AND CHANNEL ALL OUR ENERGY AND RESOURCES NOT ON THE END PRODUCT WHICH IS COCAINE BUT ISSUES RELATED TO THE MANUFACTURING OF OOCAINE WE ALREADY UNDERSTAND THE ECONOMIC SOCIAL AND POLITICAL CONTEXT OF DRUG TRAFFICKING VE ARE DEALING WITH TODAY COLLATERAL ISSUE A MAGNITUDE WHICH CAN ONLY BE EXPLAINED IN RELATIVE TERMS ANALOGOUS WITH TERRORISM SABOTAGE BOMBINGS AND MASS MURDER WE FROM OUR EXPERIENCE IN READING AND THE HISTORY OF TERRORISM ABROAD AND AT HOME TERRORIST HAS THE CAPABILITY OPPORTUNITY AND THE MEANS TO BOMB OUR NEIGHBORHOODS AND SABOTAGE OUR ELEMENTARY SCHOOLS BUT WE MUST BE THANKFUL BECAUSE UNLESS MY HISTORY SERVES ME WRONG THE STATE OF FLORIDA HAS NEVER EXPERIENCED INSTANCES WHERE FORTY FOUR EXPLOSIVE HAVE BEEN PLACED IN OUR RESIDENTIAL NEIGHBORHHODS AND ELEMENTARY SCHOOLS FURTHERMORE THE TERRORIST HOWEVER DISTORTED HIS ORIENTATION MAY BE A PURPOSE AND A TARGET AND A MOTIVATION TO APPEAL TO THE EMPATHY OF SOCIETY BY ESPOUSING HIS CAUSE AND THEREFORE ,- PRAY WOULD MAKE OUR NEIGHBORHOODS AND OUR SCHOOLS AN UNLIKELY TARGET THE AND OPERATORS THE CLANDESTINE COCAINE LABS ALREADY HAVE PREYED UPON OUR RESIDENTIAL NEIGHBORHOODS AND OUR ELEMENTARY SCHOOLS WHEREAS CONVENTIONAL DRUG TRAFFICKING CAN BE CHARACTERIZED INTERACTIONS BETWEEN AND AMONGST DRUG DEALERS
