TO THE LARGEST SEIZURE OF COCAINE IN THE HISTORY OF SOUTH CAROLINA AS WELL THE ARREST SUBJECTS THEM COLOMBIAN NATIONALS WHO WERE BROKERING THE COCAINE THE MEDELLIN CARTEL IMPORTANTLY A MAJOR DRUG ORGANIZATION WAS DISMANTLED THIS INDIVIDUAL S COOPERATION WAS NOT ON THE FRINGES BUT RATHER TOTAL COMMITMENT TO ACTIVELY PARTICIPATE IN THE WAR ON DRUGS HIS INVOLVEMENT WAS BASED ON HIS BELIEF THAT YOU CAN T BE PASSIVE ABOUT DRUGS ." THAT ATTITUDE SET IN MOTION A STORYBOOK TALE A SAILING CRUISE BY THIS INDIVIDUAL AND THE AMERICAN DRUG SMUGGLERS THE CARRIBEAN TO THE PEACEFUL ISLAND OF BONAIRE WHERE THE COLOMBIANS DELIVERED KILOGRAMS OF COCAINE OVER FOOT BOAT BECAUSE THIS CITIZEN S COURAGE AND INGENUITY THE FBI WAS ABLE TO SET A SOPHISTICATED NETWORK OF ELECTRONIC EQUIPMENT TO INCLUDE CCTV WIRETAPS AND HIDDEN MICROPHONES

TO TARGET THE MOST SIGNIFICANT DRUG ORGANIZATIONS IN ADDITION THIS WILL ALLOW THE FBI SOUTH CAROLINA TO ASSIST THE STATE COUNTY AND LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT ENTITIES WITH INTELLIGENCE FOR IDENTIFYING TARGETS THEY WISH TO INVESTIGATE EITHER JOINTLY OR INDIVIDUALLY ALSO IMPLEMENTATION THE SOUTHEAST DRUG STRATEGY THE THE ESSENCE OF THIS STRATEGY IS FOR NEARBY FBI OFFICES TO CONDUCT SIMULTANEOUS INVESTIGATIONS FOCUSED ON THE SAME DRUG ORGANIZATION NETWORK BUT AT DIFFERENT GEOGRAPHIC POINTS WITH COMMON GOALS THEREBY HAVING A GREATER INVESTIGATIVE IMPACT ON THESE ORGANIZATIONS IT HAS BEEN CLEARLY SHOWN THESE ORGANIZATIONS DON T STOP AT STATE OR JUDICIAL LINES OUR EFFORTS IN SOUTH CAROLINA WILL CONTINUE TO FOCUS ON THE MAJOR DRUGTRAFFICKING ORGANIZATIONS WHICH ARE IMPORTING AND DISTRIBUTING DRUGS INTO THE UNITED AND WHO ARE UTILIZING SOUTH CAROLINA A SPRINGBOARD FOR THEIR OPERATIONS THE FBI S EFFORTS MUST BE DIRECTED TOWARD SOPHISTICATED DETAILED LONG TERM INVESTIGATIONS WHERE SUCCESS EQUALS THE REMOVAL THE ENTIRE NETWORK OF ORGANIZATION AND NOT THE REMOVAL OF EASILY REPLACEABLE LINKS WITHIN THE ORGANIZATION OR THE SEIZURE OF REPLENISHABLE DRUGS THE FBI HAS AN IMPORTANT ROLE IN THIS DRUG WAR SUPPORT OF CONGRESS ADMINISTRATION AMERICAN PUBLIC WE WILL CONTINUE TO PLAY AN IMPORTANT ROLE IN THE BATTLE — ON THE FRONT LINES GOOD NEWS WHEREVER THE STATE OF SOUTH
