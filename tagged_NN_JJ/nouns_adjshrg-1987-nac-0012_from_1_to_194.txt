MEDICAL ASSOCIATION INC THE SELECT COMMITTEE ON NARCOTICS ABUSE AND CONTROL THE UNITED STATES HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES *" OPT LAUDERDALE FLA OCTOBER P MISTER CHAIRMAN AND MEMBERS THE SELECT COMMITTEE ON NARCOTICS ABUSE AND CONTROL NAME IS DOCTOR JOSEPH H DEATSCH OF JACKSONVILLE FLORIDA MEDICAL DOCTOR AND IN MEDICAL CIRCLES IS KNOWN AN ADDICTIONOLOG1ST MY PRACTICE IS LIMITED TO THE TREATMENT OF CHEMICAL ADDICTION COURSE OF MY WORK ADDICTED TO MANY DIFFERENT DRUGS PRESCRIPTION MEDICINES HEROIN COCAINE AND OTHERS IN MY ROLE AS CHAIRMAN THE COMMITTEE ON SUBSTANCE ABUSE THE FLORIDA MEDICAL ASSOCIATION TO WHICH THE MAJORITY OF MEDICAL DOCTORS IN FLORIDA BELONG THIS POSITION FOR A80UT THREE YEARS ALTHOUGH MY INTEREST IN SUBSTANCE ABUSE PREDATES MY WORK WITH THIS COMMITTEE FLORIDIAN AND A PHYSICIAN MUCH AWARE THAT DRUG ABUSE AND DRUG ADDICTION AND ALL THEIR SOCIAL RAMIFICATIONS HAVE BECOME A MAJOR PROBLEM IN THIS STATE REALITY OF THIS IS EPITOMIZED BY THE FACT A MAJOR COCAINE TRAFFICKING TRIAL IS UNDER WAY IN JACKSONVILLE FLORIDA AT THE PRESENT TIME THIS COMMITTEE AT THIS HEARING IS INTERESTED PARTICULARLY IN INFORMATION REGARDING COCAINE PARTICULARLY IT EFFECTS PREGNANT WOMEN AND THEIR UNBORN OR NEW80RN CHILDREN GET INTO THAT BUT FIRST THERE ARE TWO PROPOSITIONS TO SUBMIT TO YOU IMPORTANT AND SHOULD BE KEPT IN MIND WE THE COCAINE CRISIS THE FIRST PROPOSITION IS THAT ALL OF OUR EFFORTS WITH REGARD TO COCAINE SHOULD BE CARRIED OUT IN THE CONTEXT A BROADER PICTURE WE MIGHT SIMPLY CALL DRUG ABUSE OR CHEMICAL ADDICTION MANY THE PRINCIPLES OF COMBATTING COCAINE ALSO APPLY TO OTHER TYPES AND CLASSES OF BOTH LEGAL AND ILLICIT DRUGS THERE ONCE WAS A TIME WHEN MARIJUANA WAS OUR MAJOR DRUG "--- PROBLEM AT ANOTHER TIME HEROIN WAS IN VOGUE WE HEARD MORE ABOUT L S D THAN ANYTHING ELSE TODAY TH £ ORUG JUST HAPPENS TO BE COCAINE IN ITS VARIOUS FORMS IT WOULD BE NICE IF OVERNIGHT WE COULD SOLVE OUR COCAINE PROBLEM COMPLETELY DRY THE SUPPLY AND GET ALL THE UNFORTUNATE ADDICTS TREATED AND REHABILITATED IF WE COULD BE SO SUCCESSFUL ASSURE YOU THERE WOULD BE ANOTHER DRUG ON THE STREET TO TAKE ITS PLACE THE NEXT DAY THAT S WHY WE TO TAKE A MORE PANORAMIC VIEW OUR ORUG PROBLEM WE CERTAINLY NEED TO DIRECT MAJOR EFFORTS AGAINST COCAINE BUT AT THE SAME TIME WE MUST KEEP IN MIND THERE ARE MANY OTHER DRUGS OUT THERE THE SECOND THING WE SHOULD REALIZE IS THAT NO ONE PERSON NO ONE ORGAN IZATION THE CONGRESS AND NOT THE FLORIDA MEDICAL ASSOC IAT ION — IS GOING TO SINGLE HANDEDLY AN END TO THE COCAINE PROBLEM OR ANY OTHER DRUG RELATED CRISIS PROBLEM IS SIMPLY TOO BIG FOR UNILATERAL APPROACHES THE HEALTH CARE DELIVERY SYSTEM THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM FAMILY RELATIONSHIPS AND MANY OTHER FACETS OUR SOCIETY ARE NOT ONLY AFFECTED BUT HEAVILY BUROENED THE ANSWER TO THE PROBLEM AN ANSWER PROBABLY LIE IN THE SYNERGISM WHICH IS TYPICALLY INHERENT IN BROAD BASED EFFORTS IN WHICH ALL INTERESTED GROUPS AND INDIVIDUALS PARTICIPATE AND COOPERATE PROBLEM IS NOT MERELY
